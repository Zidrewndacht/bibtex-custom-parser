        Also add a tooltip for LLM namme
OK  Add new column to table and/or detail row:

OK  Add missing columns to table and/or detail row:
OK        Model name

OK        Also add counter of total papers and total filtered papers
OK    Remove signal handler + set_flags, etc. from automate_classification.py
OK    Change "changed by" to icon instead of model name, consistent with "verified by"
OK    Fix bogus table shading after filtering
OK    Fix model_name not showing in GUI
OK    Fix "other defects" not showing in GUI
OK    Fix "datasets" not showing in GUI
OK    Fix instances of computer_graphics instead of computer_vision

    Import bibTeX from GUI?
OK        Automatic Dedup by DOI?
    
OK?   Send to LLM from GUI
OK        Refactor automate, verify .py
OK        Reprocess and verify all?
OK        Reprocess remaining?
OK        Verify remaining;
OK?            Prevent verifying unprocessed papers;
OK        "Classify this paper" from detail row?
OK        "Verify this paper" from detail row?

        Allow discarding a paper from DB in GUI?
                Maybe not, be consistent with the search sentence

OK    automate never reaches final status, stuck at 'processed 524/524' papers after finishing.
OK        Do not search inside thinking traces (as it may think about things the given paper doesn't have, etc.)

        Reset 'verified' after 're-classify this paper' or manual changes.

        Fix css
        Tell the verifier that "None" is as valid as null.

        Finer-grained classes:
                Features:
                        Tracks (short, open, mouse bite, spur, spurious copper, wrong trace space/width)
                        Holes 
                        Missing component;
                        Wrong/misplaced component;
                        Wrong orientation/polarity of component;
                        Solder (Cold solder, bridging, excess solder, pinhole);
                        Cosmetic defects (any manufacturing defect that does not actually affect functionality: scratches, dirt, etc.);
                Techniques: 
                        Classic CV (pattern matching, manually-programmed feature analysis etc. May or may not leverage optimization algorithms, like genetic, PSO, etc.)
                        Classic ML (SVM, Random Forest, K-NN, LVQ, etc.)
                        DL: Standard CNN (classifiers: ResNet, EfficientNet, etc)
                        DL: Region-based CNN (detectors: R-CNNs, EfficientDet, most YOLO versions)
                        DL: Transformer (e.g. ViT, DETR, etc.) or mixed CNN+Transformer (e.g. YOLOv12)
                        Hybrid/Ensemble methods (including ML+DL, classic+DL, not including 'hybrids' of DL+DL)
