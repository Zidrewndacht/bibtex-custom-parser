	abstract = {For defect detection in nonperiodical pattern images, such as printed circuit boards or integrated circuit dies found in the electronic industry, template matching could be the only applicable method to tackle the problem. The traditional template matching techniques work in the spatial domain and rely on the local pixel information. They are sensitive to geometric and lighting changes, and random product variations. The currently available Fourier-based methods mainly work for plain and periodical texture surfaces. In this paper, we propose a global Fourier image reconstruction method to detect and localize small defects in nonperiodical pattern images. It is based on the comparison of the whole Fourier spectra between the template and the inspection image. It retains only the frequency components associated with the local spatial anomaly. The inverse Fourier transform is then applied to reconstruct the test image, where the local anomaly will be restored and the common pattern will be removed as a uniform surface. The proposed method is invariant to translation and illumination, and can detect subtle defects as small as 1-pixel wide in a wide variety of nonperiodical patterns found in the electronic industry.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop and put into practice an automatic optical inspection (AOI) system based on machine vision to check the holes on a printed circuit board (PCB). We incorporate the hardware and software. For the hardware part, we combine a PC, the three-axis positioning system, a lighting device, and charge-coupled device cameras. For the software part, we utilize image registration, image segmentation, drill numbering, drill contrast, and defect displays to achieve this system. Results indicated that an accuracy of 5 μm could be achieved in errors of the PCB holes allowing comparisons to be made. This is significant in inspecting the missing, the multi-hole, and the incorrect location of the holes. However, previous work only focuses on one or other feature of the holes. Our research is able to assess multiple features: missing holes, incorrectly located holes, and excessive holes. Equally, our results could be displayed as a bar chart and target plot. This has not been achieved before. These displays help users to analyze the causes of errors and immediately correct the problems. In addition, this AOI system is valuable for checking a large number of holes and finding out the defective ones on a PCB. Meanwhile, we apply a 0.1-mm image resolution, which is better than others used in industry. We set a detecting standard based on 2-mm diameter of circles to diagnose the quality of the holes within 10 s.},

In this paper, we propose a modified low-complexity NCC scheme to discover the location of missing integrated circuits (ICs) in automatic printed-circuit board (PCB) inspection. In the proposed scheme, 2-D sub-images in the matching process are converted into 1-D feature descriptors. The running sub-images are scanned vertically and horizontally, augmented with spatial statistical measures, and then transformed by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to create the feature descriptors. Experimental results of template matching on a 32-image dataset of PC and mobile phone PCBs show that the proposed scheme is more efficient and outperforms the traditional NCC and other schemes based on 1-D representations. Also, signal-to-noise measures show the robustness of the proposed technique against noise.},

	abstract = {Precision positioning is very important for automatic assembly and inspection in the electronic manufacturing process. In this paper, we propose a fast image alignment method using the expectation-maximization (E-M) technique. The proposed algorithm is especially applied to positioning and defect inspection of printed circuit boards (PCBs). It can well handle deformed or incomplete object shapes with translation, rotation, and scale changes. The Canny edge detector is used to generate the edge maps of images. The E-step of the E-M procedure finds mutual edge points in both compared images by assigning weights to individual edge points. The mutual edge points give larger weights, while the foreign edge points in two images have smaller weights. The M-step then calculates the geometric transformation parameters using the weighted edge points in individual images. For an edge point in one image, a fast spiral search is proposed to find its corresponding edge point with the shortest distance in the other image. The spiral search is carried out by a predetermined lookup table, and no computation is involved in the search process. The weight of each edge point is inversely proportional to the neighboring distance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed E-M positioning method can achieve a translation error less than 1 pixel and a rotation error smaller than 1° for PCB positioning.},

Therefore, the high cost of human visual inspection at verify and repair system (VRS) station is becoming a problem. Therefore, we propose an automatic defect verification system, called Auto-VRS, to decrease the false alarm rate and reduce operator's workload. The proposed system is composed of two subsystems, referred to fast circuit comparison and deep neural network based defect classification. The fast circuit comparison is to find the accurate defect region of interest (ROI). The deep neural network based defect classification is to verify which is real defect or pseudo defect. The experiment results showed that the Auto-VRS can recognition defects well and has the significant reduction in both false alarm rate and escape rate. With the advantage of the Auto-VRS, it can further improve the VRS operator's efficiency and accuracy in the future.},

The PCB inspection involves detection of defects in the PCB and classification of those defects in order to identify the roots of defects. In this paper, all 14 types of defects are detected and are classified in all possible classes using referential inspection approach. The proposed algorithm is mainly divided into five stages: Image registration, Pre-processing, Image segmentation, Defect detection and Defect classification. The algorithm is able to perform inspection even when captured test image is rotated, scaled and translated with respect to template image which makes the algorithm rotation, scale and translation in-variant. The novelty of the algorithm lies in its robustness to analyze a defect in its different possible appearance and severity. In addition to this, algorithm takes only 2.528 s to inspect a PCB image. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified by conducting experiments on the different PCB images and it shows that the proposed afgorithm is suitable for automatic visual inspection of PCBs.},

	abstract = {The surface defects of printed circuit boards (PCBs) generated during the manufacturing process have an adverse effect on product quality, which further directly affects the stability and reliability of equipment performance. However, there are still great challenges in accurately recognizing tiny defects on the surface of PCB under the complex background due to its compact layout. To address the problem, a novel YOLO-HorNet-MCBAM-CARAFE (YOLO-HMC) network based on improved YOLOv5 framework is proposed in this article to identify the tiny-size PCB defect more accurately and efficiently with fewer model parameters. First, the backbone part adopts the HorNet for enhancing the feature extraction ability and deepening the information interaction. Second, an improved multiple convolutional block attention module (MCBAM) is designed to improve the ability of the model to highlight the defect location from a highly similar PCB substrate background. Third, the content-aware reassembly of features (CARAFE) is used to replace the up-sampling layer for fully aggregating the contextual semantic information of PCB images in a large receptive field. Moreover, aiming at the difference between PCB defect detection and natural detection, the original model detection head (DH) is optimized to ensure that YOLOv5 can accurately detect PCB tiny defects. Extensive experiments on PCB defect public datasets have demonstrated a significant advantage compared with several state-of-the-art models, whose mean average precision (mAP) can reach 98.6\%, verifying the accuracy and applicability of the proposed YOLO-HMC.},

However, applying the method to other production lines, environmental variations, such as lighting, orientations of the sample feeds, and mechanical deviations, led to the degradation in detection performance. This article proposes an effective self-adaption method that collects “exception data” like the samples with which the Artificial Intelligent (AI) model made mistakes from the automated optical inspection inference edge to the training server, retraining with exceptions on the server and deploying back to the edge. The proposed defect detection system has been verified with real tests that achieved a detection rate of 99.99\% with an FAR 20\%-30\% and less than 15 s of inspection time on a resolution 7296 {\textbackslash}times 6000 PCB image. The proposed system has proven capable of shortening inspection and repair time for online operators, where a 33\% efficiency boost from the three production lines of the collaborated factory has been reported [6]. The contribution of the proposed retraining mechanism is threefold: 1) because the retraining process directly learns from the exceptions, the model can quickly adapt to the characteristic of each production line, leading to a fast and reliable mass deployment; 2) the proposed retraining mechanism is a necessary self-service for conventional users as it incrementally improves the detection performance without professional guidance or fine-tuning; and 3) the semiautomatic exception data collection method helps to reduce the time-consuming manual labeling during the retraining process.},

To overcome these limitations, various studies tried to replace ICT using visual inspection methods; however, visual inspection methods cannot be applied to chip resistors and chip capacitors that do not have externally visible characteristics. In this article, we propose a contactless inspection method that can detect PCBA defects without the use of the fixture and ICT by using the comparison of thermal images and deep learning (DL) analysis. We review the existing contactless inspection methods and compare them with our proposed thermal image analysis method. We analyzed thermal images by applying a structural similarity index map as a rule-based object detection method, and we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), regions with CNN features, and an autoencoder as DL analysis methods. As a result, we achieved highly accurate defective component detection and location in real time.},

The current practice in electronics industry is to examine the deposited glue by a human operator a process that is both time consuming and inefficient especially in preproduction runs where the error rate is high. In this article, we propose a system that automates fault diagnosis by accurately estimating the volume of glue deposits before and even after die attachment. To this end, a modular scanning system is deployed that produces high-resolution point clouds whereas the actual estimation of glue volume is performed by (R)egression-Net (RNet), a three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural network (3DCNN). RNet outperforms other deep architectures and is able to estimate the volume either directly from the point cloud of a glue deposit or more interestingly after die attachment when only a small part of glue is visible around each die.

Its widespread integration is evident in modern electronic devices, spanning computers, cell phones, televisions, digital cameras, and diverse apparatus. Ensuring product quality mandates meticulous defect inspection, a task exacerbated by the heightened precision of contemporary circuit boards, intensifying the challenge of defect detection. Conventional algorithms, hampered by inefficiency and limited accuracy, fall short of usage benchmarks. In contrast, PCB defect detection algorithms rooted in deep learning hold promise for achieving heightened accuracy and efficiency, bolstered by their adeptness at discerning novel defect types. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of machine vision-based PCB defect detection algorithms, traversing the realms of machine learning and deep learning. It commences by contextualizing and elucidating the significance of such algorithms, followed by an extensive exploration of their evolution within the machine vision framework, encompassing classification, comparison, and analysis of algorithmic principles, strengths, and weaknesses. Moreover, the introduction of widely used PCB defect detection datasets and assessment indices enhances the evaluation of algorithmic performance. Currently, the detection accuracy can exceed 95\% at an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5. Lastly, potential future research directions are identified to address the existing issues in the current algorithm. These directions include utilizing Transformers as a foundational framework for creating new algorithms and employing techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning to enhance PCB defect detection performance.},

Denoising autoencoders take a corrupted image and try to recover the intact image. We trained our model with defective PCBs and forced it to repair the defective parts. Our model not only detects all kinds of defects and locates them, but it can also repair them as well. By subtracting the repaired output from the input, the defective parts are located.

In the literature, traditional feature extraction-based methods require designing hand-crafted features and rely on the tiered red green blue (RGB) illumination to detect solder joint errors, whereas the supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches require a lot of labeled abnormal samples (defective solder joints) to achieve high accuracy. To solve the optical inspection problem in unrestricted environments with no special lighting and without the existence of error-free reference boards, we propose a new beta-variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) architecture for anomaly detection that can work on both integrated circuit (IC) and non-IC components. We show that the proposed model learns disentangled representation of data, leading to more independent features and improved latent space representations. We compare the activation and gradient-based representations that are used to characterize anomalies and observe the effect of different beta parameters on accuracy and untwining the feature representations in beta-VAE. Finally, we show that anomalies on solder joints can be detected with high accuracy via a model trained directly on normal samples without designated hardware or feature engineering.},

	abstract = {In the PCB manufacturing industry, one of the most important aspect of the production is quality checking. PCB boards goes through lots of production process from panel cutting to laminating and one single defect in a board will make the entire board become obsolete. With the rise of electronic appliances demand every day, the demand for higher quality components is rising. With the high price tag of commercial AOI, lots of manufacturers are not able to do an automated inspection. This is where Computer Vision can provide an alternative for commercial AOI to assist small scale manufacturers to do an automated inspection. Image Subtraction and Blob detection enable users to easily find numerous visual defects in PCBs especially with a complex method. By dissecting pictures and pointing out the differences on the output image, PCBs can be inspected quickly to find out the defective parts. And thus, this thesis will focus on the basis that a basic image subtraction will be enough to assist Manufacturers in Quality Inspections.},

	abstract = {Automated surface inspection (ASI) is critical to quality control in industrial manufacturing processes. Recent advances in deep learning have produced new ASI methods that automatically learn high-level features from training samples while being robust to changes and capable of detecting different types of surfaces and defects. However, they usually rely heavily on manpower to collect and label training samples. In this paper, a generic semi-supervised deep learning-based approach for ASI that requires a small quantity of labeled training data is proposed. While the approach follows the MixMatch rules to conduct sophisticated data augmentation, we introduce a new loss function calculation method and propose a new convolutional neural network based on a residual structure to achieve accurate defect detection. An experiment on two public datasets (DAGM and NEU) and one industrial dataset (CCL) is carried out. For public datasets, the experimental results are compared against several best benchmarks in the literature. For the industrial dataset, the results are compared against deep learning methods based on benchmark neural networks. The proposed method achieves the best performance in all comparisons. In addition, a comparative experiment of model performance given a different number of labeled samples is conducted, demonstrating that the proposed method can achieve good performance with few labeled training samples.},

In this article, we propose the deep neural network regressors for fast and accurate image alignment. They are especially applied to the positioning of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The simple multilayer perceptron (MLP), the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the CNN models incorporated with support vector regression (SVR) are proposed and evaluated for the PCB positioning task. The proposed deep neural networks require only one single reference sample with a manually marked template window. All training images and the ground-truth geometric parameters are automatically generated for the model training. The effect of illumination changes and the strategies to cope with lighting variations are analyzed and proposed for robust positioning. Experimental results indicate that the proposed regressors can achieve a subpixel accuracy in translation and yield a rotation error less than 1° with 1-ms evaluation time for PCB positioning.},

Programming the inspection machines is time consuming and requires a good understanding of the optical inspection domain and printed circuit boards. The process of creating such inspection programs needs to be simplified to enable the user to get to inspection results easier and faster. Over the last few years better and affordable computational hardware helped developing the field of artificial neural networks, called deep learning, to an extent, that it surpassed other state of the art approaches and is used in many optical classification tasks since then. With the ongoing trend of Industry 4.0 AOI systems started not only producing but also storing vast amounts of data. This has the potential to aid the improvement of the inspection machines. This paper will discuss key aspects of AOI as well as basics of deep learning and proposes a new way to integrate these techniques for the manufacturers and users of AOI machines. Additionally, the process of programming AOI inspections will be faster.},

YOLO is a kind of fast object detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The deep network architecture of CNN can detect discrimination features from all of the input images, so we do not need experts to define image features. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, samples of PCB images with nine kinds of capacitors are collected and trained by YOLO. Experimental results show all the types of capacitors in PCB can be detected and the average detection time is less than 0.3 second.

In this article, an adaptive defect-aware attention network (ADANet) is proposed for PCB defect detection, and it contains two main modules: small defect preserving and location (SDPL) and defect segmentation prediction (DSP), where the SDPL module is designed to extract the high-resolution and multiscale defect feature representations to avoid the loss of small defects caused by model depth and then locate their positions with a deformable Transformer, and the DSP module is developed to predict their categories and masks. Experimental results conducted on two PCB datasets show that the proposed ADANet can surpass state-of-the-art approaches and achieve high performance in multiscale defect classification and detection results.},

In addition to electrical testing, optical analysis is an important step for quality control in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing. Two approaches are reported in the literature for the inspection of printed circuit boards: the referential and the non-referential approach. Recently the DeepPCB database, composed of PCB images for identification and classification of defects, was published. This work assess the application of transfer learning strategies to detect defective PCBs in a non-referential method. Since the DeepPCB dataset is too small to train a deep model from scratch, we evaluated some strategies of transfer learning from pre-trained models VGG16 and ResNet50. Given that the PCB images from DeepPCB does not present the same complexity of the ImageNet dataset, feature extraction from a less deep model as VGG16 presented better results. The best-evaluated model obtained an accuracy of 89\%.},

	abstract = {Automatic optical inspection for manufacturing traditionally was based on computer vision. However, there are emerging attempts to do it using deep learning approach. Deep convolutional neural network allows to learn semantic image features which could be used for defect detection in products. In contrast to the existing approaches where supervised or semi-supervised training is done on thousands of images of defects, we investigate whether unsupervised deep learning model for defect detection could be trained with orders of magnitude smaller amount of representative defect-free samples (tenths rather than thousands). This research is motivated by the fact that collection of large amounts of defective samples is difficult and expensive. Our model undergoes only one-class training and aims to extract distinctive semantic features from the normal samples in an unsupervised manner. We propose a variant of transfer learning, that consists of combination of unsupervised learning used upon VGG16 with pre-trained on ImageNet weight coefficients. To demonstrate a defect detection, we used a set of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) with different types of defects - scratch, missing washer/extra hole, abrasion, broken PCB edge. The trained model allows us to make clusters of normal internal representations of features of PCB in high-dimensional feature space, and to localize defective patches in PCB image based on distance from normal clusters. Initial results show that more than 90\% of defects were detected.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the novel state-of-the-art Dual-attention Transformer and Discriminative Flow (DADF) framework for visual anomaly detection. Based on only normal knowledge, visual anomaly detection has wide applications in industrial scenarios and has attracted significant attention. However, most existing methods fail to meet the requirements of logic defect detection under complex semantic conditions. In contrast, the proposed DADF presents a new paradigm: it firstly leverages a pre-trained network to acquire multi-scale prior embeddings, followed by the development of a vision Transformer with dual attention mechanisms, namely self-attention and memorial-attention, to achieve global-local two-level reconstruction for prior embeddings with the sequential and normality association. Additionally, we propose using normalizing flow to establish discriminative likelihood for the joint distribution of prior and reconstructions at each scale. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed DADF approach, as evidenced by the impressive performance metrics obtained across various benchmarks, especially for logic defects with complex semantics. Specifically, DADF achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC scores of 98.3 and 98.4, respectively, on the Mvtec AD benchmark, and an image-level AUROC score of 83.7 and a pixel sPRO score of 67.4 on the Mvtec LOCO AD benchmark. Additionally, we applied DADF to a real-world Printed Circuit Board (PCB) industrial defect inspection task, further demonstrating its efficacy in practical scenarios. The source code of DADF is available at https://github.com/hmyao22/DADF. Note to Practitioners—Most of the current industrial visual inspection techniques can only detect structural defects under uncomplicated semantic settings. Detecting anomalies in products featuring intricate components and logical defects with high-level semantics remains a considerable challenge. The presented DADF is a robust model that can effectively identify defects in products with complex components, such as Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). Furthermore, it can also accurately detect both structural and logical defects, which is of significant importance for practical industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Ball grid array (BGA) package components are widely used in various electronic products, as they shorten the conductive path and greatly reduce the interference during current transmission. The BGA component solder ball has little flexibility for distortion, which may cause stress concentration and solder joint cracking. Red ink dye stain analysis testing can visually analyze the cracking area and the interface of the solder joint. At present, most companies use failure analysis (FA) specialists to observe the components and circuit board end images with a microscope. As component packaging technology becomes more complex and the number of input-output (I/O) signals of the chip increases sharply, FA operations require a long time and may be misjudged due to personnel fatigue and subjective determination. This paper aims to develop a machine vision image recognition system for intelligent decision analysis to judge the severity of solder ball cracking and the cracking interface type. This system uses charge-coupled devices (CCDs) to obtain the image. First, this paper uses affine transformation compensation to perform horizontal correction, which recognizes the actual position coordinates of each solder joint, estimates the solder ball according to the Hough Circle to obtain the center and the radius of the solder ball, and then a 2-D vector map (Gerber) file is used to establish the mask, and the region of interest (ROI) in the image feature is obtained through the iterator of the pixel access program. Second, the color space is converted from red, green, and blue (RGB) to hue, saturation, and value (HSV) to reduce the effects of light variations during image capture. This paper develops the range analysis model (uses the multiple-threshold method to judge whether a particular pixel in an image has the cracking (color) feature, as well as its cracking interface), and uses a morphology filter to filter image noise (filter pixels of overlapping features). The verification results show that the system developed in this paper and FA specialists have a consistency of more than 85\% in the judgment of the severity of the cracking, and the false alarm ratio and the escape ratio of the system are about 9\% and 16\%, respectively. Regarding the judgment result of the solder ball cracking interface type, the consistency reaches 98\%, which shows that the automatic failure identification system for solder joints, as developed in this paper, can effectively assist red ink solder joint FA.},

	abstract = {Noncontact optical imaging is frequently used in the inspection and metrology of stationary objects, including in particular the reconstruction of the 3-D surface profile. A technique, known as phase-measuring profilometry, involves projecting a sinusoidal pattern and then inferring the height of various points on the object by measuring the resulting phase changes at the respective locations. However, this method cannot be directly applied to systems involving moving objects, as the translation and the perspective geometry effect manifest as errors in the height calculations. In this paper, we report on an imaging and numerical surface profilometry with error compensation technology (INSPECT) measurement system that is tailored for moving objects. We model the imaging system that considers the nonlinear perspective geometry effect, and simplify to a first-order equation using Taylor series expansion. With this, we generalize the conventional phase shift algorithm, and develop the optimization procedures that can compute the height information effectively. We apply this technology to the INSPECT measurement system in semiconductor manufacturing and show significant improvement in accuracy and robustness.},

In order to design the development process of AOI system systematically, a series of guidelines are proposed in this paper based on the practical experience. Many important issues are listed and discussed. Some practical examples are used to illustrate the importance of guidelines. The guidelines are also mapping to the traditional waterfall model for better understanding. They are expected to be helpful to increase the efficiency of AOI system development.},

The PCB manufacturing process is highly complicated and severely affected by social factors, which makes it very important to conduct integrated inspection, assuring and improving the production quality. In this article, we propose an artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution-based integrated inspection method in cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS) to realize smart manufacturing. In this inspection system, rather than simply performing modeling, analysis, and control, we perform descriptive intelligence to construct production processes with limited multimodal information, perform predictive intelligence to conduct defect detection and defect prediction, and perform prescriptive intelligence to achieve defect diagnosis and defect management. In this way, our inspection system could offer a learning and training platform for workers to master professional inspection skills, provide an experimentation and evaluation platform for product defect monitoring and early warnings, and supply guidance about defect management and control to improve manufacturing processes. For technical implementation, we leverage a Transformer-based foundation model to achieve knowledge reasoning and human–computer interaction. As a result, we provide an innovative solution to cope with the challenges of quality inspection in current smart manufacturing, and expect its further applications in the PCB industry.},

To meet the requirement of 3-D AOI with large measurable volume, high speed, and high precision, a practical structured light imaging system based on the micro fringe projection profilometry is proposed. To be compatible with the traditional 2-D AOI system, an optical configuration with an axial bitelecentric lens camera and a lateral Scheimpflug projector is adopted, which helps to achieve a large depth of field (DOF). Adapting to the constraint of limited space for calibration target movement, a simplified and precise telecentric camera calibration method is proposed, which requires no auxiliary device such as micropositioning stage. Then, an improved bundle-adjustment method is introduced to globally optimize the calibration parameters. To accelerate the 3-D reconstruction, we further propose a ray backtracking algorithm after the corresponding point matching by using a modified telecentric camera model. It is demonstrated in experiments using real PCBA and microstructure components that the system DOF is 8 mm with a field of view of 32 mm {\textbackslash}times28 mm. The reconstruction time is shortened to 40\% of the traditional method.},

Damages may occur in curved structures during manufacture or use, which may endanger the equipment’s operation safety. Efficient tools for inspection of buried defects in curved structures are still lacking. This article proposes a flexible nondestructive testing probe with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors for inspecting buried defects in curved structures for the first time. The probe contains 16 TMR sensors and the distance between each 2 adjacent sensors is 2 mm. The TMR sensors are fetched from a customized wafer and screened to guarantee the consistency. In this probe, the TMR sensors are wire bonded on a flexible printed circuit board and then protected by polyurethane pouring sealant. The probe can be bent to fit an irregular surface with minimum bending radius 5.5 mm. The selection of the excitation frequency and the proposed probe performance for buried defects’ inspection are studied using a 3-D finite-element numerical model. Experimental results demonstrate that defects buried 3 mm below the top surface of cylindrical samples can be accurately detected. A chromatic confocal distance sensor is employed to sketch the curved surface of an irregular shaped sample. The electromagnetic image and optical image of this sample with curved surface are plotted in a fused image, which presents comprehensive information of the sample about both the structural pattern and the buried defects’ indications.},

According to the assumption that only normal images are available during the training stage, unsupervised methods have been studied recently for image anomaly detection. But anomalous images of small scale can be collected for training in many real-world industrial scenarios, and the unsupervised methods make no use of them to improve the detection accuracy. This leads to semi-supervised image anomaly detection with an unbalanced detection challenge. In this article, a logit inducing with abnormality capturing (LIAC) method is proposed to address semi-supervised image anomaly detection. First, a logit inducing loss (LIS) is proposed to train a classifier for dealing with unbalanced detection. Second, an abnormality capturing module (ACM) is proposed to address anomaly detection. With labeling only 40 anomalous images for training, the proposed LIAC method achieves a 98.8\% F1-score on image anomaly detection of the printed circuit board, compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, the proposed LIAC method is experimentally compared with the SOTA methods on magnetic tile defect (MTD), retinal optical coherence tomography (ROCT), and electroluminescence images of photovoltaic modules (ELPV), three open-source datasets, respectively, which achieve F1-score of 85.2\%, 96.8\%, and 66.6\% with given 40 anomalous images for training.},

In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of previously unexplored board-level modifications and show that a number of attack modes cannot be detected using traditional methods.

Many methods have been proposed to tackle the problem, either by traditional machine vision or by deep learning (DL) techniques. The traditional methods rely on template matching or feature point correspondence. They are computationally intensive and are easily affected by illumination changes and noise. DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are computationally very efficient but are also sensitive against environmental changes. In this article, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model based on the Actor-Critic style Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm(s) (AC-PPO) is proposed. The proposed method is applied for the positioning of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The model uses as the current environment the sensed image and the reference template as a guide. It requires only a single manually marked template in the reference image. All possible training images are automatically and randomly generated during the neural network training without human intervention. The proposed reinforcement learning (RL) model is shown to be adaptive to environmental changes, including illumination, noise, de-focusing, and template occlusion, compared with the CNN regressor. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model on average can achieve estimation errors less than 1 pixel in translation and 1° in orientation, with fast evaluation for the real-time PCB positioning task.},

Detecting integrated circuits (ICs) on PCBs poses a significant challenge due to diverse component sizes, types, and intricate board markings that complicate accurate object detection. This study addresses this challenge by proposing an enhanced EfficientNet-YOLOv4 algorithm tailored explicitly for the IC detection of PCBs. Numerous modifications are integrated into YOLOv4, with the replacement of its original backbone by a robust feature extraction network, EfficientNetv2-L, and meticulous hyperparameter tuning, including variations in loss functions, anchor size configurations, and other training techniques. The methodology further incorporates diverse data augmentation techniques to enrich the training dataset and enhance the model’s generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted in this study showed the efficacy and robustness of the algorithm in handling complex PCB layouts and varying lighting conditions, outperforming existing PCB inspection models. The proposed method, EfficientNetv2-L-YOLOv4, achieved an impressive F1-score of 99.22 with an inference speed of 0.14 s per image. The proposed method also performed well compared to EfficientNet-B7-FasterRCNN and the original YOLOv4; it attains an F1-score of 98.96 and an inference speed of 0.10 s per image (with a batch size of 4). These results highlight the significance of effective feature extraction networks for object detection. Beyond addressing IC detection challenges, this algorithm advances the fields of computer vision and object detection. The implementation of EfficientNetv2-L-YOLOv4 in real manufacturing scenarios holds promise for automating component inspections and potentially eliminating the need for human intervention.},

An intensity gradient-based algorithm is developed and applied to the digital hologram to automatically locate the reconstruction plane and determine the propagation distance. For a given range of distance, the algorithm calculates the maximum value of high-frequency components in the reconstructed image, and the corresponding propagation distance is used in the reconstruction. The autofocus algorithm along with the double exposure digital holographic interferometry (DHI) is applied on the PCB under thermal loading. 2-D and 3-D deformation maps are analyzed to detect different kinds of solder joint defects, such as holes, irregular shapes, excess soldering, and bridging.

	abstract = {Traditional injection molding processes have been widely used in the plastic processing industry. It is the major processing technique for converting thermoplastic polymers into complicated 3D parts with the aid of heat and pressure. Next generation of electronic circuits used in different application areas such as automotive, home appliances and medical devices will embed various electronic functionalities in plastic products. In this study, over-molding injection molding (OVM) of electronic components will be examined to insert novel performance in polymer materials. This low-cost manufacturing process offers potential benefits such as, reduction in processing time, higher freedom of design and less energy used when compared to the conventional injection molding method. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of this process and propose a series of alternative solutions to optimize the adhesion between and integration of electronics and engineering plastics. A number of methods are used to optimize the process so that the electronic circuits are not damaged during the overmolding, moreover to test the reliability of the system in order to control the continuity of connections between the electronic circuit foils and the electronic components after the OVM process. Correspondingly, we have performed specific tests for this purpose varying in some conditions: the type of injected plastic used, overmolding parameters (temperature, pressure and injection time), electronic circuit design, type of assembled electronic components, type of foils used, and the effect of using underfill material below the electronic component. From these tests, first conclusions were made. We have also studied adhesion between the foil and the over-molding material. In this case, various types of engineering plastics have been tested; polypropylene (PP), 30\% weight percentage glass fiber filled polypropylene (GF-PP), Polyamide-6 (PA6) and 50\% weight percentage glass fiber filled polyamide-6 (GF-PA6). It was proved that throughout the wide range of tested materials, (PA6) over-molded samples showed a better adhesion on the copper-polyimide foils than the rest. These plastics were over-molded on two types of polyimide (PI)/Copper (Cu) tracks foils with and without an adhesive layer between PI and Cu. It was obviously clear that the foils with an adhesive layer between PI and Cu had more delamination in the Cu tracks than the foils without an adhesive layer. Furthermore, it was shown that the presence of an underfill material has an effect on the system as the foils that had an underfill material below their components successfully had a better connection than the foils without an underfill material. Finally, experiments were executed using the two-probe method as an electrical measurement and microscope investigation as the visual inspection.},

High false call rate is a fundamental concern of AOI machines that occurs when a component is considered as a ‘fail’ incorrectly that then have to be verified manually. In order to alleviate this problem, we train and compare different machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Network) and thresholds using logged fail data and extracting the efficient categorical and numerical features. The results show that the trained classifiers are able to identify the false calls well and increase the accuracy without increasing the error slip much. The K-Nearest Neighbor model, with a low threshold achieves the best result.},

The proposed structure utilizes a mix of transmission line and substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) interconnected with an in-substrate embedded back-short. The transition, in all its configurations, targets a fractional bandwidth (FBW) wider than 20\% to cover the commercial E -band spectrum. Moreover, at center frequency the predicted insertion loss (IL) for both normal and flipped transitions is 0.4 and 0.46 dB, respectively. Parametric and yield analyses, together with postmanufacturing inspections have been performed to assess the robustness of the design and to identify the critical manufacturing inaccuracies.

Automated optical inspection (AOI) systems, employed by manufacturing quality control teams, are designed to accurately detect these defects in a timely manner, thereby reducing the underkill (false negatives) and overkill (false positives) rates. An AOI system requires optimal settings for resolution, brightness, camera angle, and data variety to ensure effective defect detection. However, consistently achieving these ideal conditions in a manufacturing environment presents challenges. Our proposed framework enhances defect detection through data preparation and detection modules, effectively addressing these manufacturing challenges. We developed one- and two-stage object detectors and assessed their performance using precision, recall, and intersection over union metrics. Our framework employs a diverse range of augmentation techniques to effectively train the defect detectors, enabling the expansion of a limited data set. The trained detectors are evaluated using real-world data. We assessed quality control plans across various confidence thresholds. At a 65\% confidence threshold, one-stage detector models did not exhibit any false negatives and had minimal false positives. The You Only Learn One Representation (YOLOR) model outperformed both one-stage and two-stage detectors, achieving 100\% precision and recall, a 96\% mIoU, and an impressive inference time of 11 ms, making it an ideal choice for high-production printed circuit board assembly lines.},

The most significant aspect of printed circuit board production is AOI or Automatic Optical Inspection. When generated in a single quantity, the PCB requires a small way to teach and change the AOI method for process validation. This paper proposes a mechanism of detection of capacitors trained on circuit boards using the YOLO V3 algorithm. YOLO is a form of rapid object detection based on the convolutional neural network or CNN. CNN’s deep network can distinguish specific characteristics from all the image features. The study developed an AI with the same feature that the manufacturing industry uses to assist students with an effective evaluation of their circuit boards. It focuses on the capacitor in a circuit board. It will not, however, be capable of distinguishing other forms of electronic components. Nearly 60 percent of the entire test has a performance of 100 percent detection, according to the test results, while 33.33 percent is over 70 percent detection and 6.66 percent has a 0 percent detection output. Capacitor recognition has been done with an overall testing accuracy of 93.33\%.},

Then, several similar templates are selected from these ViBe templates via template clustering to better characterize various appearances of qualified solder joints. A balanced potential defect images (PDIs) set is constructed to achieve the evaluation model with optimal weights, which involves the proposed random template strategy for unqualified samples and similar templates for qualified samples. The evaluation model is formulated as the optimization problem of the least square regularized by the L1 - and L2 -penalties, which can adaptively determine the weights of pixels in the PDI. Experimental results indicate that the proposed inspection method outperforms some state-of-the-art inspection methods, which demonstrates that it is a promising inspection method for IC solder joints.},

The printed circuit board (PCB) design is a central part of electronic products and therefore is the part where most constraints are enforced. Although PCB designers already address design constraints with the help of Electrical Computer Aided Design (ECAD) tools that can verify product design rules in an automated manner, there are still many product design rules that are left out of the ECAD tools verification engines, in particular the design rules related to PCB manufacturing and assembly. These rules are many times verified by human visual inspection. This fact increases the risk of running into design errors, leading to increased costs during production phase. This paper proposes a rule ontology representing the large range of constraints imposed by the production phase of electronics products. The rule-based ontology is implemented using a Visual Programming Language (VPL) that facilitates the encoding of the knowledge provided by electronics products manufacturing experts. A practical example is also presented, describing a PCB manufacturing rule and its graphical representation.},

To address the limitations of the 1-D modulation method, a 16{\textbackslash}times 4 pixel area pattern fringe is adopted. Then, the optimal binary defocusing grating is obtained by an optimal blurred factor determination method. The accurate geometric measurement results are obtained from the high-quality 3-D point clouds. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiment results show that the proposed method has higher phase accuracy and point cloud accuracy than the other methods.

Certain ceramic materials have high mechanical strength, low thermal expansion, high electric barrier and high thermal conductivity. These properties are idea for devices pf designated purpose such as high power IC, LED and fast communication IC. For these applications via holes for signal and power connection are necessary. As the devices are miniaturized the sizes of via holes are forced to be reduced even down to tens of micrometers, thus, the drilling task can only be performed by laser. However, the ceramics are brittle and during the laser machining process the thermal stress and shock may easily cause defect in the heat affected zone. Also the debris generated in the thermal fusion-solidation process deteriorate the integrity of the via hole such as the in-out diameter, taper angle and roughness around the via. There is a trade-off between machining efficiency and quality has to be tuned. In this paper we apply a 12 picosecond 1033 nm wavelength laser to study the photo material interaction for drilling micro via in three thin plates of AlN, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 ceramic. AlN and Al2O3 are good heat dissipation material and Fe2O3 is idea for electronic noise immunity.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for automatic inspection of residual stress images based on bending testing for flexible transparent conducting substrates. A flexible characteristics inspection system with single-direction common-path image interferometry is utilized to inspect residual stress images automatically during the bending testing operation. Accordingly, a 5 × 5 cm2 residual stress image of a 203-μm line pattern on a conducting Indium tin oxide (ITO) film deposited on Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with up to 11000 bending cycles is inspected and analyzed. The relationship between the residual stresses and resistance characteristics of the 203-μm line pattern on the ITO-deposited-on-PET substrate based on bending testing is also analyzed. It was found that the change results of the residual stress can predict the resistance characteristics of the ITO-deposited-on-PET substrate sufficiently. Therefore, the inspection results of residual stress images depicted on flexible electronics may help designers and manufacturers to develop products and ensure quality control, respectively, in a manufacturing process.},

	abstract = {Sensing systems for autonomous driving must be reliable and robust in order to fulfill highest safety demands. Especially in urban environments, this requirement translates into developing sensors with very high angular resolution (less than ± 1°) in the near and medium range (up to 100 meters from the car) and a maximum angular detection range (ideally ± 90°) in horizontal plane. In this way, the separate detection of small targets, such as pedestrians, that are very close to each other is possible. RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) systems compared to LIDARs (Light Detection and Ranging) still exhibit poor resolution and the detection range is typically limited to ± 30°. Therefore, considerable technological effort has recently been dedicated to enhance the detection range of RADAR systems without sacrificing the economical advantage. To address this issue, a project with focus on a scalable and low-cost 79 GHz MIMO Radar-Frontend module for autonomous driving was defined with the goal to develop a 3D antenna concept and a related manufacturing technology to increases the angular detection range to ± 90° and improve the angular resolution with respect to the 1°. This technology approach based on 3D compression molding suitable to be combined with fan-out wafer level packaging (FOWLP) or substrate mold embedding. Compression molding is the standard process for manufacturing of reconfigured wafers with embedded bare dies for FOWLP and PLP (panel level packaging). Typically, planar, large and thin formats as e.g. wafer shapes are manufactured by compression molding. Materials used for encapsulation are highly filled epoxy resins. These epoxy molding compounds (EMC) are very well adapted to microelectronics packaging needs. This technology has now been further developed to manufacture 3D shaped structures. In combination with direct metallization of the EMC 3D shaped antennas can be realized. For functional antennas additionally a ground layer is needed with a defined distance to the antenna layer. Hence, a 3D double molding process in combination with direct metallization on EMC was developed. For metallization a seed layer was sputtered on the molding compound followed by copper plating. Structuring of the Cu was done by subtractive etching. Several types of resists (film and liquid) have been systematically evaluated in combination with laser direct imaging to investigate their suitability for 3D metallization. Laser drilled and metallized μ vias are used to connect the antenna to the ground layer and e.g. to the radar front electronics. In addition to the described double mold approach with direct metallization the same 3D molding technology can be also used to embed and shape flexible RF substrates with antenna structures and assembled components. In summary, this paper describes in detail the technology development of 3D compression molding to realize a free form antenna for a 79 GHz MIMO Radar-Frontend module. This also includes the demonstrator manufacturing and electrical characterization of the antenna.},

	abstract = {Defect inspection (to detect, classify, measure and analyze) has long been a challenging task in semiconductor manufacturing (MFG) domain. This paper discusses a new Machine Learning (ML) approach which can be used to assist defect inspection in different MFG scenarios. Associated solutions have been developed and applied to the surface defect inspection for substrate components, used in our IC packaging MFG.During the past decade, the help from image-based Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) equipment has significantly reduced manual efforts in substrate/PCB defect examination, but is still insufficient in defect classification automation. Recently, the adoption of ML and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Learning technologies raised much hoping to advance the defect classification automation to a new level that acceptable for rigid MFG practices. Most of the published CNN models, however, tend to use large number of learning parameters (floating-point variables) during computing in order to gain high image recognition accuracy. The parameters' massive blow-up often causes heavy power-gobbling computation. While applying CNN to our substrate defect datasets, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of high-resolution images, collected across different MFG processes and produced products, a training run could take days or even weeks to finish. Also, more the learning variables for training are used, longer the inference time will be. The situations make these complex CNN models hard to meet our overnight retraining and in-line inference time constraint. Therefore, to develop a more efficient ML method is strongly preferred in our MFG environment.In this paper, we develop a feature-spanning ML approach which takes the feature of an image as a base. Through mathematical transformations the base is spanned to fit into an accumulated and gradually divided feature-of-classes space. During the feature-spanning process, the initialization of parameters is tightly controlled, which means the redundancy blow-up is carefully calculated to optimize the usage of computation resource.To demonstrate the advantage of our ML method, the public dataset CIFAR-10 is used for benchmarking. CIFAR-10 dataset contains sufficient diversity and is small enough to have quick observations on computing performance. Our results indicate that the parameters used by our method are only 5.6\% of ResNet-101's. We also apply this new ML technology to the inspection of several substrate defect types. In particular, defects on solder mask are hard to be recognized because their pattern's colors are quite similar to the substrate background. The benchmarking shows very competitive results as compared with other CNNs'. Further benchmarking shows our ML method holds high degree of shift invariance property, implying that our method can help to resist MFG condition changes during the defect inspection operation.Our ML approach requires much less learning variables, and thus can achieve very fast training and inference speed. While adopted in MFG production lines, it helps to reduce computing cost/energy and comply with Green Factory policy. Besides, our ML technology has high scalability, capable of performing heterogeneous learning on data combined from different aspects, such as image plus CAM design reference, Z-height or time-series signal waveform. For continuous development efforts, we are making the ML behavior in our AI-for-MFG applications more explainable, controllable, and be self-adaptive to changes in MFG environment.},

	abstract = {Printed Circuit Boards are mostly seen in all electronic products in daily life. PCBs are easily rejected due to different kinds of defects that slow down the manufacturing process. Defects like spurs, shorts, pinholes, and mouse bites cause issues like leakage of current and open circuits, which affects the performance of PCB. PCB manufacturers must give their utmost priority to delivering defect-free products to remain in the market among various competitors and to meet customer satisfaction. PCB analysts are employed in every industry to ensure that the defects are kept to a minimum or negligible level. But manual inspection of PCB defects is really very challenging, time-consuming, and an unreliable process. There are many defects to detect, which are extremely low tolerance for errors, and significant experience is required to reliably recognize and handle such flawed units. An automated solution for detecting and classifying defects in PCBs is in great demand. Automated defect detectors have significant roles in the quality control of PCB manufacturing sectors due to automated inspection adaptions instead of manual inspections. Defect recognition and individual component position detection are the major concerns in PCB inspection system design. Proper positioning of components improves the operating speed and system accuracy. In this article, a full PCB defect Detector used to automate the detection and classifying defects in printed circuit boards is discussed. It can be implemented in local PCB manufacturing industries. The proposed PCB inspection system functions with maximum accuracy in suitable illumination conditions.},

	abstract = {Automated visual inspection has become a popular topic of research in the last couple of decades, as computation power available grew exponentially. Judging by the fact that visual inspection is a critical task for the quality of the products, it would be highly recommended that people only supervise the system. This paper proposes a low cost, rapid development defect detection system based on the Scaled-YOLOv4 object detection model. The original model achieves almost state of the art detection mAP on the COCO dataset with a mAP(mean average precision) of 56.0 for the largest variant, named YOLOv4-P7. Our version is derived from the ScaledYOLOv4-P5 model and is trained on ceramic plate defects and achieves 87.4 mAP at a intersection of union of 0.5, while comfortably processing a frame in 20ms on a consumer RTX3070 GPU. Thus, the real time constraint for the manufacturing system is fulfilled. Hence, the critical aspects of the development process are the: quick development process, fast training, rapid deployment on the factory floor, quick validation and feedback, using images acquired in the lab - not on the factory floor for first iteration and overall low cost of the automated inspection system.},

	abstract = {During the last 25 years, major shifts occurred in the electronic assembly industry, such as the transition to contract manufacturing and reduction or elimination of in house manufacturing, the switch from solvent cleaned rosin fluxes to low solids no-clean fluxes and the big shift from leaded solder to Lead-Free solders. The preferred method for cleaning high reliability surface mount assemblies was to employ a suitable solvent batch or inline machine, to clean traditional leaded rosin flux wave solder solvent wash process (Figure 1).1 The fluxes would be reduced from the Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) with a solvent degreasing process. Visually the board would appear very clean because of the reduction of the amber flux, but when the boards were placed in a water environment the clear flux residue around the leads would turn white. Traditional rosin flux, left a clear film on the board and sealed in the board fabrication and flux activators and visually appeared clean. This is because the solvents used to clean the flux only removed the top 2/3rds off the surface and left a clear film.PCBA cleanliness was monitored using visual inspection and a ROSE (Resistivity OF Solvent Extraction) test system of a process that meet product validation. The ROSE test measured the amount of equivalent m grams of NaCl/sq. cm, by immersing the PCBA in a solution of 75\% IPA/25\% water.2 This total board average cleanliness reading was a result of the change in the conductivity and the algorithm used to calculate the detectable contamination.3 IPA was selected as weaker solvent that was in the degreasers to soften the rosin and measure the extractable activators and yet safe to labels and ink ID markings.The use of this ROSE monitor for historical rosin-based fluxes with solvent cleaned assemblies appeared to meet the needs of the time, but when the entire chemistry of electronic assembly changed, including fluxes (no solids), laminates, soldermask and not cleaning, this tool was not able to correlate to field performance as a predictor of reliability.Process monitoring of the new no-clean or cleaned processes that passed a ROSE test on the production floor may, or may not, pass during environmental testing, or perform well in the field. As technology has expanded in areas of use, miniaturization and circuit sensitivity, the traditional total board average cleanliness has not correlated to the failure areas that are under a component, between vias, pads, or leads requiring a new definition of cleanliness and how it is assessed.4, , This can be seen in IPC 5702 and 5704 that the IPC recommends that each company determine what level of cleanliness that they require to be included on their print and has not established cleanliness guidelines.6The proliferation of electronics in all aspects of life including medical, wearables, telecom, cell and automobiles is on an exponential growth curve.7, , As electronics complexity increases (Figure 2), the spacing between conductors is decreasing and the circuitry is more sensitive to parasitic leakage caused by the presence of semi-conductive ionic and organic materials.This paper will explore the ever more demanding cleanliness requirements of PCBAs and methods to monitor and assess the cleanliness of electronic assemblies today.},

Traditional inspection methods rely on the intuitive visual judgement of the operator, with strong subjective judgement factors, low accuracy rates and high staff costs. Deep learning can be a good solution to this problem to reduce the investment in human and material resources. A method/network structure for PCB defect detection based on deformable convolution has been proposed. The aim is to address the problems associated with existing PCB defect detection algorithms, which include low detection accuracy, poor real-time performance, and insufficient robustness. The network depth is increased to extract more and higher-level semantic information, which is guaranteed to be gradient-free under the resnet feature improved. The improved network model has demonstrated enhanced performance in the field of PCB defect detection. Specifically, it has outperformed the original RetinaNet network model by achieving a 3\% increase in mean accuracy(mAP) on the PCB defect detection dataset. Additionally, the detection speed of the modified model satisfies real-time requirements, further demonstrating its practical utility.},

	abstract = {Some elements can be extremely harmful for both environment and human health. If it is not possible to avoid them completely, they must remain at least within the certain limits. This situation is more common especially in electrical and electronic manufacturing due to the usage of leaded alloys in solders and finishes. In this case, European Community, United States, Japan and some other countries have at least approved the use of these chemicals within the maximum limits defined by RoHS (Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances) Directives which is 0.1\% ppm for lead. RoHS rules came up in the early 2000s became mandatory in Europe, United States and Japan in the field of commercial electronics in the last half of next decade. Manufacturers switched to lead-free solder and component production and usage rapidly as a result of this situation. This rapid transition has brought many question marks and information gaps. Certain industries such as military, aerospace, transportation and space are excluded from RoHS Directives. However, switching of electronic component manufacturer to lead-free technology brings some problems such as finding leaded components and reduced number of leaded product supplier in time for space and similar industries. Reliability is one of the most important and critical factor in space technologies. Lead-free solder alloys and technologies has different properties compared to leaded alloys in terms of process to material. Leaded alloys are highly reliable and traceable compared to lead-free alloys. Reliability level of lead-free alloys should be defined by destructive, non-destructive, accelerated tests and inspections and also a lead-free plan should be prepared if lead-free solder alloys are planning to be used in space technologies.},

Therefore, this paper focuses on the simulation of these steps. The calculation of the solder joint shape requires minimizing the surface tension energy. For this, the algorithm discretizes the energy equations over a heightmap. The proposed software architecture for the simulation is highly extendable and facilitate future development. Experiments with the simulation of solder joints of a chip resistor show a remarkable similarity to real images from an automatic optical inspection machine.},

Specifically, a new mechanism of hierarchical decision based on DCNNs is built for FICS fault diagnosis, wherein the challenge of unbalanced data is addressed in the network learning process to reach a good trade-off between detection accuracy and speed. The substantial experiments and effectiveness comparison by using the typical methods on three categories of FICS and their corresponding eight-type faults reveal that the proposed system could facilitate the solution of substrate fault measurement and achieve high accuracy and efficiency, which could provide essential information of FICS to divide its industrial acceptance quality level.},

	abstract = {Pre-reflow Automated Optical Inspection(AOI) has been widely applied in the Printed Circuit Board(PCB) manufacturing to perform quality control. Two common problems in AOI-based recognition are how to realize the rapid inspection and how to predict the position and rotation angle of the PCB component quantitatively. However, the traditional—template matching algorithm tends to be exceedingly inefficient and non-robust. In this paper, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)-based method on the PCB resistor classification and pose prediction. For the problem of requiring a large number of labeled samples to train the CNN, we achieve the generation of the resistor dataset through extracting Region of Interest(ROI) and data augmentation. We employ the CNN which directly use the 11 types of resistor image as input and resistor type or pose error as predicted result. The classification accuracy is 99.60\%. And the method predicts a one-dimensional vector including horizontal position, vertical position and rotation angle, achieving 99.98\% accuracy. The processing time of a PCB resistor image is about 9ms. The experimental results have well demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {In the fields of electronics manufacturing, the application of through-hole devices is still required, as heat dissipation and high current carrying capacity plays an important role. To ensure the highest quality standards, these electronics production processes take a multitude of inspection processes into account. For the detection of error patterns regarding the quality of the solder connections, usually, high-end inspection machines are utilized in the industrial application. The Automated Optical Inspection is a commonly conducted process, using visible light and rule-based inspection routines, setup by process experts for the evaluation of the Region of Interest. The high overhead of creating and maintaining product-specific checking routines and machine acquisition leads to increased costs and severe dependency on expert know-how. A flexible inspection algorithm, implemented into low-cost equipment for image generation is expected to reduce acquisition and optimization costs, and lower dependency on expert knowledge and high-end machinery. In this contribution, we present a novel framework for the automatic, near real-time solder joint classification based on Convolutional Neural Networks, flexibly detecting, and classifying solder connections. We utilize existing Deep Learning architectures for detection and classification. The localization model utilizes a YOLO-architecture (you-only-look-once), learning feature inputs based on a supervised learning approach. Pseudo-labeling is carried out automatically by an anomaly detection model. The image generation is executed by an industrial low-cost camera and an industrial rack-PC. The developed prototype is integrated into the existing production infrastructure. The results indicate a satisfactory detection and classification of the investigated solder connections with the proposed system. Hence, this system represent an alternative to commercially available high-end inspection systems being used for an inline control of Pin-in-Paste and through-hole device solder connections.},

The working principle is based on zero-power harmonic generation to insulate the sensor node signal at 2.45 GHz from the interrogation signal’s channel at 1.225 GHz. In order to modulate sensing data with the carrier signal, a six-port modulator is integrated with four capacitive comb-like sensing structures, “CombS. ” Different characteristics of the metal surface cracks make the sensors as variable impedance loads for the modulator. The CraSen sensor offers robustness and higher sensitivity, due to its phase sensing parameter, compared to the frequency or magnitude variation sensors for damage detections. The main features of CraSen offer advantages in terms of simplicity, low cost, easy fabrication, and measurement. Applying this sensing method provides strong potential in developing smart structures for eliminating in-person inspection and maintenance as well as preventing serious structural failures.},

This work established the basis for the current activities in Phase Two. A fine featured test vehicle was designed and fabricated using thin film processing technologies on both glass and silicon substrates to evaluate and assess the limits of today's AOI metrology equipment. The test vehicle also provided a platform to develop future metrology capability required to close the technical gaps with respect to product requirements and process and material capabilities.The test vehicle samples were provided to various industrial AOI equipment suppliers to evaluate their capabilities in evaluating fine lines and spaces. The integrity of the fine wiring lines and spaces was compared between a control pattern and known defects utilizing wiring patterns from 10 μm lines and spaces to 1 μm lines and spaces. Various types of features including different orientations were evaluated: a) Line width violations; b) Spacing violations; c) Excess copper or missing copper; d) Shorts; e) Opens.

We propose a nondestructive dual-modal imaging system that utilizes the light absorption contrast of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and light scattering contrast of optical coherence imaging (OCI). Dual-modal PAI/OCI visually identifies surface and internal defects on FPCBs that cannot be detected by the current automatic optical inspection (AOI) system in a manufacturing environment. The PAI/OCI feature is seamlessly integrated into a compact and coaxial setup using a cutting-edge optically transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT). Internal features, invisible to optical microscopes, are successfully visualized using the proposed system, which intuitively identifies inner layer delamination and internal defects.

Jigsaw puzzle pieces can be used to simulate the scenario of misplaced and missing components. The developed system consists of image processing and neural network phases. During image processing, the captured image is split into regions and the red-green-blue (RGB) value of the regions is obtained. The back-propagation neural network is used and is trained by the scaled conjugate gradient training algorithm. The neural network uses the RGB value obtained from image processing and analyzes regions to determine if a jigsaw puzzle piece is missing or misplaced. Two experiments on time performance have been conducted to analyze regions and the ability of the system to detect misplaced and missing jigsaw puzzle pieces. Results showed that the system requires approximately 89 s to process 20 pieces of the image. The system exhibits almost 100\% accuracy in detecting missing or misplaced regions of a jigsaw puzzle image.},

	abstract = {Modern technology relies on the integrity of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) printed circuit boards (PCB), which often offer high performance at low cost compared to custom-designed alternatives. Due to the lack of visibility into the global supply chain, the manufacturing of these electronics can introduce deviations from the original design. One way to ensure that these devices functions as intended is to non-destructively decompose the manufactured assembly into a description of its design, often in the form of a netlist. However, automated decomposition of PCBs is non-trivial, as components, pins, and traces may be obscured, hindering the efficacy of the netlist extraction process. Therefore, we propose a surface imaging solution to extract the PCB netlist while overcoming these challenges. We formulate extraction as a segmentation problem and train a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to identify their locations on the board. Experimentation shows that the multimodal imaging improves the models' ability to correctly segment traces and pins. We also show that the choice of loss function is critical to successfully applying an FPN to this extraction problem.},

First of all, it is necessary to take the template image that fully meets the quality requirements of the parts, and carry out preprocessing such as smooth filtering for the image taken. Second, during the test, the image of the component to be tested is taken on the assembly line, and the position of the detection target image and the standard template image is registered through the image registration algorithm. Finally, the image features of each partition area of the image to be detected are extracted and compared with the features of each partition area of the standard template image, so as to detect the processing quality of the assembly line parts, whether there is a component assembly error, error prompt and alarm, so as to achieve intelligent detection Purpose.},

Due to the increasing miniaturization and higher density of components on PCBs along with the complexity and diversity of ICs, detecting and identifying defects in these electronic components is a critical issue. We proposed a defect recognition model based on feature extraction for ICs and an automatic optical inspection system (AOI). The research methodology consisted of five steps: data collection, IC localization, IC correction, feature extraction, and defect recognition. Data was collected in two parts: circuit board data and IC data. For IC localization, YOLOv4 was used to locate ICs on the circuit board and zoom in, magnifying them for easier defect feature extraction and reducing background noise. For IC correction, a horizontal projection correction method was used to analyze variations in black pixels among different angles in the image to determine and correct the horizontal tilt angle of the IC. Feature extraction was achieved by using image annotation tools to outline the regions of pin defects. Defect recognition involved training a YOLOv4 model on 1500 images and then using an additional 200 test images to evaluate the model’s performance. The region recognition rate reached 98.2\%, and after comparing the recognized defects with actual defects, the recognition accuracy reached 96.2\%.},

	abstract = {In Recent years, flexible printed circuit boards (FPC) have been widely used in consumer electronic products. The problem of automatic visual inspection of defects including pinholes, scratches and particles in FPC surfaces has been considered in this paper. A global 1-D Fourier based image reconstruction scheme that directly works on the 1-D line images instead of the traditional 2-D images is proposed. It firstly eliminates the frequency components that represent the periodic pattern of a FPC line image in the 1-D Fourier spectrum, and then transforms the 1-D Fourier domain image to the 1-D spatial domain image based on the inverse Fourier transform. The Fourier reconstruction process can effectively remove the patterned background and distinctly preserve local anomalies in the resulting 1-D image. Experimental results on a number of micro-defects embedded in FPC boards show that various ill-defined defects without designing and measuring the quantitative features of individual defect types can be reliably defected in this proposed method.},

	abstract = {Wettable flank QFN is a specialized type of Quad Flat no Lead that is capable of forming visible toe fillets on its four-sided edges during soldering. Toe fillets are made possible by the solderable sidewall feature of the package, which appears on different forms such as dimple, curved punch, Sn immersion plate, or step cut. In the assembly of wettable flank QFN with step cut, one of the biggest challenges is the production of Sn metal burr. Sn burr is undesirable because it can cause electrical shorting between adjacent leads and packaging tilting during soldering. Getting rid of this defect is essential to improve assembly manufacturing yield. Thus, the objective of this work is to use chemical deburring as process solution for eliminating Sn metal burrs on wettable flank QFN package. A 2k full factorial experiment was performed to study the effect of deburring process factors. From the result, it was revealed that belt speed and electropolish voltage are significant process factors that affect deburring performance. Lead stand-off tends to get deeper with decreasing belt speed and increasing electropolish voltage. Data from experiment also showed that more than 99\% assembly yield with respect to Sn burr rejects can be attained by introducing chemical deburring process on wettable flank QFN package.},

An electronic device's PCBs are the first stage in production, so even a small error there could cause serious flaws in the finished product. Finding and identifying flaws in PCBs is crucial given the size and demand of the PCB industry. In this paper, we propose a reference comparison method for PCB defect localization and classification that employs a template and a test picture and integrates machine learning and image processing techniques. We introduce a solution pipeline that works in three stages: Subtraction of Images where the test images are subtracted to generate a mask that highlights the regions of defect on the test image, Contour search to find the contour of the defects from the generated test image, and Model Inference where the contours found above are extracted from the images and fed into our machine learning model which then classifies those defects in the test image. We train the machine learning model, in our case, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that forms the artificially intelligent (AI) part of our solution which can identify the type of defect present given the image of the defect as input. Our experimental findings demonstrate that, compared to other traditional methods utilized for this work, our model diagnoses the afflicted parts with 97\% accuracy.},

An effective segmentation method helps to reduce the influence of the irrelevant factors, thus largely augment the performance of defect inspection in the following process. In this paper, a method of segmentation of the gold finger area of FPCB was proposed to solve the problem of adhesion between gold finger and cover film. First, a Gaussian filter was applied to the grayscale image. Second, a blurry edge image was obtained by the residual image between the Gaussian image and the other after an erosion operation. Third, a binary image was created by using an adaptive threshold method, and finally, with the application of histogram statistic, the rectangle area of gold finger was extracted. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately locate the gold finger area for our FPCB images. In addition, it takes 2.654s to extract the ROI with the adaptive threshold and 1.442s without it. By feeding it to a classifier, a total time of 3.903s was spent to analyze the possible defects, which means the algorithm is suitable for automated optical inspection (AOI) for FPCBs.},

	abstract = {Infra-red (IR) cameras have found widespread use in many different fields. The most common ones are generally related to industrial applications, particularly maintenance and inspections activities. In the domain of surveillance, instead, they are mostly used for threat detection and security purposes. Pushed by cost reduction and the availability of compact sensors, intelligent IR cameras are gaining popularity in the field of Internet-of-Things, in light of the valuable information made available by the acquired data. Unfortunately, the achievable overall quality is not always satisfactory. For example, low-resolution devices, noise, or harsh environmental conditions, like high temperatures on sunny days, can degrade the quality of the thermal images. This paper presents the development of a portable, low-cost, and low-power thermal scanner prototype consisting of a thermal sensor assisted by a grayscale camera. The prototype is completely made using COTS components and provides 80 × 60 IR and 160 × 120 grayscale images, mostly used to collect and validate the IR-based data. Our application focuses on people detection, for which we present a suitable learning framework together with the corresponding IR dataset, collected and annotated via the paired grayscale images.},

	abstract = {The detection of defects has consistently posed a significant obstacle in the domain of machine vision, particularly in the context of the production of printed circuit board (PCB) components. To advance this technology, we present pair-image-based defect detection network (PIDDN), a novel framework that enables precise detection of object bounding boxes by utilizing a pair of images, with one designated as a template. The PIDDN approach involves the utilization of a Siamese neural network to simultaneously encode the features of the pair image, followed by the implementation of a template feature fusion network (TFFN) for integration. In addition, we introduce a template feature rectification module (TFRM) that aligns the feature maps of the pair-images attentively. We evaluate PIDDN on the DeepPCB dataset, and it achieves an impressive mean average precision (mAP) score of 99.6\%. Furthermore, we present PairPCB, a complex and realistic dataset collected from real-world PCB production scenarios, to validate the effectiveness of template images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIDDN outperforms mainstream object detection algorithms with a 4.1\% improvement in mAP. Code will be available at: https://github.com/QixingJiang/PIDDN.},

	abstract = {The ultrafast laser for material processing concentrates the pulse energy into the scale of picosecond or femtosecond temporal duration. The high peak power would induce nonlinear multiphoton fluorescence, material modification and photoablation with higher pulse energy [1]–[3]. With the increase of processing resolution and complexity, we would propose the noninvasive inspection method by integrating with multiphoton excited fluorescence microscopy (MPEFM) to directly monitor the processed structure in specimen for verification and analysis [1]. In this paper, we would show the setup of FPGA-based MPEFM and adopt the single photon counting (SPC) technique for high signal-to-noise (SNR) images. The image spatial resolution is submicron level. To the need of the high bandwidth electrical components and applications in industry, companies are developing different kinds of composite materials and insulators together with the technology of different kinds of laser processing methods and protocols including direct writing, drilling, and modification with etching-assistance. Glass and polyimide (PI) are important materials for the insulation layer in PCB (printed circuit board) design and the narrow electrical routing structures are especially required to be confirmed after processing [4], [5]. We have shown the MPEFM can detect the axial-resolved images of the laser modified surface on the silicon glass and the laser-cut structure on the PI film without damaging the specimen. The mechanism shows the potential for the rapid 3D inspection of the laser processed specimen.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIM.2024.3492728},
	abstract = {In the quest for manufacturing excellence, this article presents a pioneering approach to defect detection on steel surfaces. Complex and small defects on steel surfaces manifest in diverse forms, such as irregular shapes and varying sizes, making it challenging to devise a singular detection model capable of effectively detecting these multifarious defect types. Yet, another challenge lies in the close similarity between defects and nondefective components. Additionally, the fluctuating environmental factors exposed to steel structures introduce noise and artifacts into image data, compounding the complexity of precise defect detection. To address these issues, we initially employed the Swin Transformer as the core element of Faster R-CNN. Second, we ingeniously integrated a path aggregation feature pyramid network (PAFPN) into the architecture. This allows us to capture a comprehensive array of defect feature maps and enhance the network’s capability to identify defects at various scales. After that, we swapped out the region-of-interest (RoI) pooling for the more sophisticated deformable pooling method to get more precise defect localization information. Finally, the standard intersection over union (IoU) loss is substituted with complete intersection over union (CIoU) to address issues of duplicate proposals and improve overall performance by taking into account the geometry of the bounding boxes in addition to their overlaps. Our proposed Swin Transformer Defect Detector (STD2) has been rigorously evaluated on diverse steel surface defect datasets, including NEU-DET (yielding an impressive mean average precision (mAP) of 81.05\%), GC10-DET (with a notable mAP score of 72.38\%), and printed circuit board (PCB) (achieving an outstanding mAP of 99.00\%), which demonstrate its exceptional performance in surface anomaly detection.

At the moment, large-scale circuits have extremely small pitches and line widths that can be several microns. Inspection of printed circuit board faults is thus one of the essential components to offer quality assurance. Assuring PCB quality includes checking for mouse bites, missing holes, spur on routing path, open circuit paths, and short circuit paths. Manual inspection takes a lot of time, and since human beings are limited, manual errors are possible because of the need for manual interventions. We are attempting to automate and construct an intelligent visual inspection system using deep neural networks and computer vision. Vision-based analysis of the micro dimensions of a PCB is difficult since a camera can only capture a single view of an image with a limited field of view. To get a wide field of view in this instance, we used picture stitching by registration and fusion. Therefore, this research provides a high-precision micro vision image stitching technique using computer vision and fault detection of PCB using deep learning methodology.},

The above is an alternative to the originally proposed through-hole screw joint and studied snap-fit joints, which are a better choice at higher frequencies. Joints employing conductive glue and low-temperature solder were assessed by measurement of test vehicles being a long WR-42 sized waveguide section in-between two through-patch microstrip to AF-WG transition operating within 18 GHz to 26.5 GHz bandwidth. The obtained results show that solder joints might be attractive in terms of minimizing power losses, however, special care must be taken during the assembly process.},

The paper is the first experimental study of the behavior of such a structure subject to mechanical stress. As known, the most common mechanical stress for electronics is vibration, but its parameters are different depending on the industry (aerospace, automotive, military, etc.). Regarding the vibration test, there are several types according to the purpose: performance, endurance, shipping. Our experiments were based on a well-known standard, MIL-STD-202G. The test module is a flat rectangular board made of two layers of epoxy resin embedding electronic components interconnected in a daisy-chain circuit. Tests and measurements (optical inspection, electrical continuity) were made before, during, and after vibrations. The lack of visible damage and undetectable interruption of the electrical circuitry is proof of the robustness of such structure when submitted to the recommended procedure from the Method 201A of the specified standard.},

Implementing computer vision techniques in PCB defect detection can improve inspection processes' accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness. Deep learning is now used in those processes to explore important technology. This study presents a novel automated method for defect identification using deep learning methods. The system is built utilizing AlexNet, U-Net, ResNet 101, and Inception-v3, prominent frameworks known for their outstanding capacity to extract pertinent visual data components. The proposed technique comprehensively composes PCB photos, including faulty and defect-free samples. This training enhances the system's capacity to precisely differentiate between conventional PCB designs and six additional categories of errors. The suggested architecture of the CNN models consists of double process layers represented as ConV I, Pooling I, ConV II, and Pooling II. The validation procedure is carried out by using a range of learning rate data. The implementation findings indicate that the ResNet-101 variant achieves the highest testing accuracy of 99.286\%. Indeed, incorporating this technology into the PCB manufacturing process enables the prompt identification of defective PCBs, leading to less waste, enhanced product quality, and heightened satisfaction among end-users.},

	abstract = {Using solder paste inspection (SPI) and automated optical inspection (AOI) data, accurate prediction for repair labels of soldering defective printed circuit board (PCB) components can help reduce labor costs. Existing research tries to pick out both the false defect components (actually good) and impossible-to-repair components among defective PCB components, using SPI and AOI data. However, it is inappropriate to pick out the false defect components from screened components using defective information in AOI data. Therefore, the problem setting of existing research is inappropriate, resulting in the algorithm's performance not meeting actual requirements. To address this problem, we only care about the reliable prediction of impossible-to-repair components. We propose a hierarchical component feature extraction method that can comprehensively characterize the degree of component defects from multiple levels, including pin level and component level. Then we apply the ensemble model based on XGBoost and TabNet and adjust the probability threshold of components judged as impossible-to-repair category, achieving the reliable prediction of impossible-to-repair components. Finally, we validated our method on real datasets and achieved better experimental results compared to baseline methods, which can meet actual requirements,},

In this paper, we propose an improved version of sub-pixel edge location method based on partial area effect to acquire better sub-pixel points for fitting the circular marks. In stead of the simple one direction offset model, a composite offset model is adopted to diminish the positioning error as much as possible in the case of small gradient differences between horizontal and vertical directions. Besides, the constraints of both gradient magnitude and angle are also introduced for filtering the sub-pixel points at each edge pixel in order to effectively improve the quality of the fitted circle. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real PCB mark images have verified the better performance of the proposed method in terms of anti-interference and location accuracy.},

	abstract = {In the manufacturing process of a ceramic resonant cavity with a PCB, different components of the PCB have different light reflectivity, which greatly reduce the defect detection accuracy. In this paper, a defect detection system with its defect detection algorithm for complex PCB surface is proposed, which is suitable for manufacturing workshop. Some images of good samples are selected in advance and are fused as the template image. Then the template image is divided into three parts due to the light reflectivity of different material bases. Through the template matching between the template image and the image to be detected, an affine transformation matrix is obtained. After matching, the difference between the template and the target image can greatly reduce the interference caused by the different light reflectivity of the material base, and improve the detection efficiency of cross-regional defects. The algorithm has been well applied in actual production. At present, the number of samples detected has exceeded 100,000, and the average detection speed is about 1s/piece. Using the result of manual inspection as standard, every actual defective sample is selected, and the precision rate of samples is 98.3\%.},

	abstract = {A printed circuit board (PCB) is a vital component of any electronic device. Over the years, the need to manufacture PCBs in large volumes has become a necessity due to technological advancement and the expansion of the consumer market. Small defects in the PCB signal trace can have adverse consequences on the functionality of an electronic device. Initially, the quality control process of PCB inspection was carried out manually which was not only tedious but also susceptible to human error. To automate this process, different techniques were developed using classical machine vision that comprised reference comparison, subtraction of images and morphological operations. The methods were effective and reduced inspection time but were sensitive to noise, rotation, and scaling of images. It was difficult to detect defects in complex patterns and only a small fraction of defects could be detected through classical techniques. In this study, four YOLOv5 models were tested for the classification and localization of defects in PCBs. Transfer learning on the bare PCB defect dataset was implemented using pretrained weights of YOLOv5. The PCB dataset was composed of 2,079 images with 6 classes of PCB defects. Data augmentations were carried out to increase the dataset which enhanced performance and generalizability of the models. The models were trained and tested at different image resolutions. Promising experimental results were achieved with the medium YOLOv5 model reaching a mean average precision of 96.92\%.},

A human inspection is important to ensure that the PCBA is delivered in excellent condition. It is critical to train QC employees to understand PCBA inspection standards to determine which PCBAs are acceptable. High rates of PCBA reject, even though the defects are acceptable to the customer, will have an impact on production costs. To improve Quality control performance, the development of decision-making skills of PCBA visual inspection employees was researched. Because to the COVID19 situation, case-based training was provided via online tools. However, in order to clear up any misunderstandings and conduct PCBA inspection tests, face-to-face discussion was still needed. In addition, the trained QC employee's performance was measured using attribute gauge repeatability and reproducibility, which indicated that the QC employee's decision-making capability had increased. When compared to appraisers before training and standard respectively, employee inspection performance was 11.94 \% and 5.69 \% better.},

	abstract = {The inspection of solder paste stencils is a critical step in the production process of electronic devices to prevent issues caused by residual solder paste on the stencils, which can lead to defects in the manufacturing process. This research focuses on selecting an appropriate deep learning model for inspecting and classifying the cleanliness of solder paste stencils using computer vision techniques. We propose the approach for stencil cleanliness inspection using deep learning model along with the dataset. This helps transitioning from manual observation under magnifying devices or handheld digital microscopes (USB) to a system that uses digital images captured by high-resolution cameras. These images are analyzed using deep learning models to classify stencil cleanliness, improving inspection efficiency before the stencils enter the production process. Various deep learning models, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), EfficientNetB7, and Vision Transformer, are compared based on performance criteria such as accuracy, recall, and inference time. Additionally, techniques like data augmentation and finetuning are applied to enhance learning efficiency. The dataset includes grayscale images, Sobel-filtered images to enhance edge sharpness, and raw images without preprocessing. The experimental results reveal that the Vision Transformer model achieves exceptional accuracy. The unprocessed raw images yield better classification accuracy than preprocessed images, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.875 \%. When compared to the EfficientNetB7 model using Sobel-filtered images for feature extraction [1], which achieved a comparable accuracy of 99.81 \%, the Vision Transformer was chosen due to its statistically significantly lower average loss. This indicates that the Vision Transformer is a more suitable model in terms of loss reduction. The findings were supported by a T-test result with a P-value of 0.004.},

In our proposed system, the object detection technology of You Only Look Once (YOLO) allocates the position of PTHs; a semi-automatic clustering mechanism distinguishes normal and defective PTHs for collecting training data. A convolution neural network based on the ResNet framework is established for detecting PTH defects. A retrain mechanism is designed for retracting misclassified PTHs and updating the recognition model. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is employed to deal with the insufficiency of negative training samples. The detection model can achieve 98.96\% accuracy with continuous retraining and data augmentation. Further, a filtering mechanism based on template analysis eliminates ambiguous outputs of GAN and improves the accuracy of the detection model.

This investigation proposes a method inspired by class activation mapping-based (CAM) to enhance deep neural network-based image classification algorithms by outputting an attention map where the defective area is indicated. With additional lightweight operations, it helps to roughly localize defects place in the image without using pixel-wise annotations.

	abstract = {Medical devices and instruments used in surgical procedures require sterilization and cleaning to allow their use in multiple surgeries. Any device or instrument that comes in contact with the patient, or has exposure to biological materials, requires cleaning and sterilization as a standard protocol before they can be used again. Removal of all biological materials, pathogens, debris, and contaminants from the medical device is an absolute requirement. The sterilization procedures may involve the use of harsh chemicals, high temperatures and moisture, high pressure environments, as well as vibrational frequencies, not necessarily all together. These methods have a detrimental effect on the life of the electronics included in the medical devices. These requirements are unlike anything that product life testing of electronics in the consumer and industrial fields will encounter. As such, most electronics used in medical devices face conditions which they were never explicitly designed for. Traditionally, most medical instruments that faced such reprocessing, either had very limited electronics, or had limited usage of high-density PCB (Printed Circuit Board) technologies which would be subjected to multiple such reprocessing cycles. Surgical endoscopes used in Robotic Surgeries are the exception, as they require high density, high complexity electronics packaged tightly within very small spaces (5mm-8mm diameter tubes) and are required to survive and function after undergoing multiple rounds of reprocessing and sterilization. Such an application exposes deficiencies and limitations of PCB technologies in a manner not seen in typical consumer or industrial applications. This paper seeks to highlight the unique challenges faced by PCB's and electronic components under such sterilization regimes. It also seeks to identify best design practices and technologies in PCB manufacturing for such applications, and identify what should be avoided.},

One of the most crucial quality control procedures is PCB surface inspection since even little flaws in a signal trace may have a significant detrimental effect on the system. It has always been difficult to determine the pass/fail criteria in traditional machine vision systems based on small failure samples, despite the advancements in sensor technology. Suggesting a sophisticated PCB inspection method built on a skip-connected convolutional auto encoder to address these issues suggested to enhance the PCB inspection system by using convolutional autoencoders. The original, fault-free photos and the damaged ones were used to train the deep autoencoder model. The defect location was then located by comparing the decoded images with the input image. Using proper image augmentation to enhance the model training performance in order to get over the tiny and uneven dataset in the early phases of production. Printed circuit boards, or PCBs, are essential parts of electronic gadgets and are very significant to the electronics sector. While ensuring PCB quality and reliability is crucial, manual inspection techniques are often labour and error-intensive. The proposed novel machine learning (ML)-based method for identifying PCB defects demonstrates a significant improvement in detection rates compared to traditional methods, offering a promising solution for the electronics manufacturing industry.},

	abstract = {Different from the strength design method, the environmental design method is traditionally used for instruments and equipment, which relies more on the idea of statistical probability, and the failure mode and failure mechanism are not clear. With the development of computational mechanics and measurement methods, the modeling technology and measurement technology for the complex system of instruments and equipment have made great progress. The strength based design method has been applied in the development of instruments and equipment, such as the life evaluation method based on failure physics. In this paper, with the help of analytical method and finite element simulation numerical method, the stress analysis and life evaluation of typical instrument structure are carried out. Based on the equilibrium equation, geometric equation, constitutive equation and deformation compatibility equation of mechanics, the thermal stress on the solder joint is obtained, and the structural life is evaluated according to the S-N curve. The stress analysis of various packaging forms of shell under temperature cycling load is carried out by using the finite element method. There are some problems in the optical measurement method, such as the micro deformation image is difficult to collect, the micro speckle with high contrast and high adhesion is difficult to make, and the reflection of hemispherical solder joint is difficult to suppress. The micro DIC device suitable for micro thermal deformation measurement and the manufacturing technology of anti reflective micro speckle are developed. By making high contrast anti reflective micro speckle in the test area, the micro DIC test system combined with micro lens is used to measure the micro scale deformation near the solder joint of PCB, and the correctness and accuracy of the calculation model are verified. two kinds of commonly used fatigue life models are listed, and the fatigue life of typical packaged circuit board under thermal environment is evaluated. The above analysis method is verified by the means of test and inspection. Finally, master the fatigue life assessment and test verification technology of typical instrument structure under thermal environment.

AR technology superimposes digital information onto the physical world, providing real-time, interactive visualization. By integrating AR with advanced diagnostic algorithms, technicians can quickly and accurately identify wiring faults such as short circuits, open circuits, and insulation failures. The AR system uses a combination of cameras and sensors to capture the wiring layout and diagnose issues, overlaying visual indicators of faults directly onto the live feed of the wiring.Key features of the proposed system include real-time fault localization, guided troubleshooting procedures, and the ability to visualize complex wiring schematics overlaid on physical components. The use of AR minimizes the need for extensive training, reduces inspection times, and enhances the accuracy of fault detection. Additionally, the system can log detected faults and repair actions, providing valuable data for predictive maintenance and system optimization.},

We focus on manufacturing of passive and static smart EM skins for wavefront manipulation, to enable optically transparent and conformable solutions. The most significant technological innovation of this contribution is the creation of a metasurface by means of micro-manufactured modules on a transparent medium, which allows us to reach high-resolution standards and to work on unconventional substrates. Indeed, micro-fabrication of smart skins offers many advantages, e.g. choice of materials as in this case (i.e. transparent), miniaturization and, in turn, operation at higher frequencies. This constitutes a valuable counterpart to most literature works, which exploit “standard” technologies and substrates, such as classic PCB, severely limiting the manufacturing degrees of freedom (DoF) and material variety.},

The test results show the system's ability to detect defects such as Pad Misalignment, Open Circuit, Solder Bridging, and Misplacement, with varying level of accuracy. Accuracy for Good Assembly (GA), Solder Bridging (SB), Open Circuit (OC), and Misplacement (MP) classes ranged from 70\% to 95\%, 73\% to 84\%, 67\% to 72\%, and 67\% to 98\%, respectively.

	doi = {10.1109/AUTOTESTCON47462.2022.9984716},
	abstract = {Two significant issues facing Naval Aviation avionics support are “No Fault Found” conditions and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) ceasing support of avionics systems. With older avionics requiring more labor hours for troubleshooting and OEMs no longer providing support to repair older avionics, the increase in turnaround time has depleted supply stock of UUTs. As a result, Naval Program Management Air (PMAs) and Fleet Support Teams (FSTs) have to endure negative cost and schedule impacts. In order to support troubleshooting and repair at the Intermediate (I)-level for the H-1 Wiring Integration Assemblies (WIAs), the Cherry Point Development Team developed a solution using a universal cable design to support testing of 43 WIAs. The design utilizes thirty-seven (37) Test Adapter Cables (TACs) to interface between the WIA and the A WTS-02 whereas the OEM design required 500 TACs. Using the universal design solution lead to a 90\% reduction in the number of cables, 83\% reduction in cost, and a 57\% reduction in schedule. This design provides Fleet users the capability to repair and declare Ready for Issue (RFI) WIAs directly in the field. Additionally, there is no testing or troubleshooting support available for the AV-8 Air Data Computer (ADC) Chassis. Currently, the I-level utilizes a process of elimination to identify if the fault is in the ADC chassis or the Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs). In comparison, the depot maintainers rely on a Digital Multi Meter (DMM) to perform continuity checks and perform visual checks for isolation. The maintainers follow the process until the ADC passes; otherwise, the asset is deemed non-repairable and thrown away. To reduce the hours spent on testing the ADC Chassis, the Cherry Point Development Team designed a Test Program Set (TPS) utilizing the high density circuit switching offered by Eclypse International. Instead of having fourteen (14) cables connecting the ADC Chassis to the A WTS-02, the design utilizes fourteen (14) mock CCAs, four (4) ribbon cables, and two (2) Test Adapter Cables (TACs). This innovative TPS design reduces hookup time, physical footprint and cost for the AV-8 team.},

	abstract = {Integrated silicon packages, such as System in Package, are becoming more popular as electronic packaging solutions, and this technology is driving the need for finer and finer circuit pattern designs. However, optical inspection methodologies are reaching their limits in detecting defects efficiently at these smaller dimensions. This potential technology gap could negatively impact yield performance and quality validation of the substrates or boards used for integrated SiP packages. The lack of inspection capability for fine lines and spaces on panel size substrates and boards used to fabricate SiP carriers supporting high I/O or high bandwidth memory or other components could have a negative impact on yield performance or reliability. This issue has been defined as a technical gap less than “15μm/15μm line space” design rules in the iNEMI package roadmap. iNEMI conducted an industry survey to assess the measurement and inspection capability for fine circuit pattern substrates with features less than 15μms used in high bandwidth applications. The survey is conducted across the entire electronic supply chain from substrate manufacturers to inspection equipment manufacturers, and covers the aspects of product quality and reliability, material and processing, inspection capability, analysis techniques and data management. This paper discusses the findings obtained from the survey results and makes recommendations on metrology capabilities that are required to close the technical gap, with respect to product requirements and process and material capabilities.},

Through simulations and experimental testing, various stack-up configurations were evaluated to achieve desired parameters, including a data velocity of 25GHz @ -30dB. As SiP with organic substrate technology is not introduced in the space market, test flow procedures were defined, combining ECSS, IPC and MIL standards with tailored groups to validate SIP technology, and coupons were designed for thorough testing. Manufacturing and inspection processes were conducted to ensure substrate quality and dimensional accuracy. Furthermore, chip assembly tests were performed to assess the warpage behavior of the substrate to identify the most appropriate packaging solution. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the development and qualification of complex SIPs for space applications, highlighting the importance of thorough testing and continuous improvement in ensuring reliability and performance in harsh environments.},

Conventionally, FA on display failure requires the components to be detached from the integrated display device, which involves potentially destructive steps. These may result in an alteration of the defect, preventing a precise localization and further analysis of the failure root cause of display failure. To overcome this issue, a specific FA workflow involving in-place analysis was developed. It enabled a successful localization and characterization of the defect via emission analysis from both sides of the device and cross-sectional analysis. With this new workflow, the manufacturing step responsible for the defect was well identified. This makes FA result of display failure clearer enough to give feedback to manufacturing line for process rectification.},

The dataset consists of annotated PCB images for the YOLOv5 algorithm, and the images are categorized into six defect types: missing holes, mouse bite, open circuit, short circuit, spurs, and spurious copper. The preprocessed defect images are analyzed using the YOLOv5 model for defect location, while the Inception v3 CNN model performs precise defect classification. The results and the output clearly show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in both detection and classification tasks.

	abstract = {In the semiconductor industry, the utilization of advanced visual inspection technology confronts challenges due to the scarcity of the defect data and the substantial sizes of the images involved, which pose difficulties for traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Most CNN techniques are evaluated on common resolutions, around 224 x 224 pixels, with limited literature available on their application to larger image resolutions, such as 1024 x 1024 pixels. Furthermore, the recent surge in popularity of transformer-based models, exemplified by Vision-Transformer (ViT), underscores the evolving landscape. However, ViT's efficacy, particularly with smaller datasets (less than 2000), has prompted the development of hybrid deep learning approaches like the Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT), specifically build to address problems related to large data. Hence, in this study, we conduct a comparative performance evaluation among ResNet50, MobileNet-v2, and CCT aiming to assess their effectiveness in handling large size images and small datasets drawn from real-world semiconductor industry scenarios. Our findings reveal that all three methods demonstrate commendable predictive capabilities, achieving accuracies of (LED Dataset [Binary Class] - Resnet50: 99.75\%, MobileNet-v2: 99.87\%, CCT: 97.12\%; PCB Dataset [Multi Class]: Resnet50: 94.79\%, MobileNet-v2: 95.67\%, CCT: 94.87\%) when utilizing our limited dataset sourced from actual semiconductor industry settings and publicly available resources.},

	abstract = {To improve safety and efficiency of land vehicles, such as cars and trucks, frequent tire inspections are necessary. Regular checks of tire tread depths help prevent accidents and enhance fuel efficiency. However, traditional methods for estimating tread depth, like depth gauges, can be both time-consuming and imprecise, especially for vehicles with multiple tires. In this paper, we propose a novel portable embedded Digital Processing System (DPS) device that utilizes linear image sensors (CCDs) and active illumination to estimate the depths of all tire treads at once. The device features a microcontroller that configures the linear sensor's parameters and collects its readings. The microcontroller communicates with an Android device via a serial connection to transfer the data for processing. Additionally, the Android application offers visual feedback to the user, enabling them to conduct tire inspections on vehicles. Both the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and the device case are designed in our laboratory, with the case being 3D printed. The proposed device achieves an error of 0.115 millimeters in tread depth estimation and consumes only 22.15\% of the time required by the traditional depth gauge to estimate all the tread depths of a tire. The integration of the proposed device into tire manufacturing companies can significantly enhance the efficiency of tread inspection processes. This innovation not only improves overall quality control and productivity in tire inspection but also offers substantial benefits in both scientific and economic contexts.},

The AI model was proposed for antenna characteristic prediction through line edge roughness (LER) of the fabricated patterns as a part of the automated optical inspection (AOI). FPCs of antennas in spiral shapes operating at 2.45 GHz were designed with three pattern distortions to imitate practical situations in inkjet printing; and 144 and 36 samples were fabricated as the training and testing groups for AI modeling, respectively. The capacitance value, operating frequency, and coupling efficiency in terms of intensity loss were characterized through simulation, measurement, and prediction in this work. Results indicated that along the deterioration of the LER, all three characteristics degraded as expected. Quantified statistics proved that the predicted capacitance value, operating frequency, and intensity loss exhibited remarkable correctness: root mean square error was 0.0499 pF, 0.0004 GHz, and 0.0430 dB, respectively; with linear coefficient of determination of 0.9862, 0.9828, and 0.9946 from their measured counterparts, respectively. These results outperformed those demonstrated with an AI model established with printed circuit board, which failed to reflect genuine wetting behaviors usually appear in printed electronics. The difference between the measured and predicted capacitance value, operating frequency, and coupling efficiency was merely 0.1583\%, 0.0159\%, and 0.0564\%, respectively; indicating the effectiveness and practicality of introducing the AOI and AI for off-line characteristic prediction from in-line pattern integrity of microelectronic component in a production line.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach using artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict intermetallic compound (IMC) height growth in ball grid array (BGA) component solder joints under varying rework process and temperature cycling test (TCT) conditions. IMC growth is critical for solder joint reliability, directly affecting the performance and lifespan of electronic assemblies. Traditional methods of IMC analysis require extensive experimental testing, which is timeconsuming and resource intensive. By leveraging big data from various rework processes, TCT conditions, and solder joint configurations, this study employs ANN to model and predict IMC height growth, achieving a generalized R-Square of 0.8961 for training and 0.9740 for validation, demonstrating strong predictive performance. The actual versus predicted plots from the ANN analysis validate the model, showing close alignment between predicted and actual values, especially in the validation set, confirming the model's reliability. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) inspection was performed on actual solder joint cross-sections to benchmark the ANN model's predictions against real-world samples. The SEM inspection revealed a high correlation between the predicted and measured IMC heights, further confirming the ANN model's accuracy in predicting both BGA and PCB side IMC growth. This approach underscores the benefits of leveraging artificial intelligence and big data to enhance the quality and reliability of solder joints. By providing highly accurate IMC growth predictions, the ANN model allows for optimized rework processes and TCT conditions, reducing the need for excessive experimental trials. This method not only improves solder joint reliability and long-term performance but also facilitates more efficient resource utilization in the electronics manufacturing process.},

	abstract = {In modern electronic devices, printed circuit boards play a crucial role as core components, and their quality is essential for device performance and reliability. Due to the complexity of PCB manufacturing processes, issues such as open circuits, short circuits, and solder defects often occur, affecting the overall quality of products. Traditional manual inspection methods are unable to meet high standards, leading to the gradual adoption of automated defect detection technology as the mainstream trend in the industry. This paper presents a network model for PCB defect detection, aimed at addressing the challenge of detecting small targets. We propose SmallObjectEnhancePyramid, which utilizes the P2 feature layer processed by SPDConv to obtain features rich in small object information and fuses them with P3. Then, we integrate features using CSP-OmniKernel to effectively learn feature representations from global to local. Additionally, we introduce RMTBlock to improve RepC3, reducing the computational burden of global information and model parameter quantity. This study not only improves the accuracy of PCB defect detection, but also helps optimize manufacturing processes and enhance production efficiency. Experimental results show that FPSPNet effectively improves the detection accuracy of printed circuit board defects, achieving an mAP0.5 value of 98.8\%, precision of 99.3\%, and recall of 97.3\% on the dataset. It also outperforms existing models in terms of performance.},

This paper deals with the new advanced methodology for PCB automatic inspection by using CNN-based methodology for the detection of defect on PCBs. The models were highly trained and tested with a huge dataset that was designed especially for the identification of defects in PCBs. For effective identification and classification of various defects like the irregularities, missing components, gaps and electrical shorts, this paper uses the CNN architecture. The achieved results of experiments with the model's accuracy up to 95.57\%, precision up to 95.44\% and recall up to 93.76\% underscore the importance of achieving high performance. Ensuring such stable and accurate representation of the CNN - based method makes this approach valuable in improving the production workflow.

	abstract = {Industrial defect detection is crucial for ensuring product quality and production efficiency, playing a pivotal role in advancing smart manufacturing. This paper reviews defect detection technologies for various industrial products, including metals, textiles, and printed circuit boards, and introduces an innovative classification system. It also offers a detailed analysis of recent developments and practical applications of large models in industry defect detection. First, the basic principles of industrial defect detection are outlined. The detection methods are then categorized into three main groups: traditional image processing, machine learning, and deep learning, with their principles, case studies, limitations, and future development directions analyzed. Traditional methods consist of image preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction. Machine learning methods are divided into point-distance-based, hyperplane-based, tree-based, and neural network-based classification algorithms. Deep learning models are classified into two types: accuracy-oriented and efficiency-oriented. The paper organizes industrial defect datasets by type (multi-product and single-product), evaluates data quality and availability, and summarizes common evaluation metrics for accuracy, efficiency by task requirements. It also compares the latest methods on two public datasets to guide further research in defect detection. Real-world examples illustrate the end-to-end process, from data processing and hardware configuration to model training and deployment, while exploring the value and limitations of these technologies from the perspective of industry stakeholders. Finally, a systematic analysis of the key challenges and corresponding solutions is presented at the data and performance levels, and looks forward to the future direction of technological development, highlighting innovative paths and application potentials.},

To better handle input images with varying image quality, text quality, and text variations, the robustness of deep learning approach for end-to-end text spotting on PCB component images is worth exploring. However, limitations of public PCB component datasets for such research and imbalance of data in actual collected PCB component datasets hinder the training of deep learning text spotting model, and consequently necessitate the generation of synthetic data. In this study, a synthetic PCB component dataset is generated using our synthetic data generator that adds synthetic text with random character sequences on manually edited PCB component images to elevate the realism of the synthetic images. The synthetic dataset covers 66 character classes while providing synthetic text with diverse text variations in font, style, size, and color. We train an existing text spotting model called Text Perceptron using both real and synthetic datasets to detect and recognize arbitrary-shaped text markings on PCB components. Our synthetic PCB component dataset has improved the text spotting performance of Text Perceptron. The trained model achieves promising text detection result and encouraging end-to-end text spotting F-score on real PCB component images. It also meets an acceptable average inference time per image. Still, the text spotting performance of the trained model needs improvement to realize deployment for PCB component inspection.},

To monitor the electrical characteristics of structures and the quality of technological operations, structures specially designed or placed on a working substrate, called test chips, are used. The main principle of their construction is that the test chip in relation to the real one should be made along the same technological route, contain all the structural elements in various combinations and ensure the convenience of their control during the tests and the evaluation of the quality of the technological process. Control convenience is achieved either by sequential or parallel inclusion of the chip elements in the electrical circuit. The test resistor circuit may be a sequential circuit containing a group of elements between which there are contact pads. If in a real IC there are high-resistance and low-resistance resistors, then make two different test chips that reflect the specificity of each type of resistors.

We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing user-specified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.},

GANs learn complex and high-dimensional distributions implicitly over images, audio, and data. However, there exist major challenges in training of GANs, i.e., mode collapse, non-convergence, and instability, due to inappropriate design of network architectre, use of objective function, and selection of optimization algorithm. Recently, to address these challenges, several solutions for better design and optimization of GANs have been investigated based on techniques of re-engineered network architectures, new objective functions, and alternative optimization algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing survey that has particularly focused on the broad and systematic developments of these solutions. In this study, we perform a comprehensive survey of the advancements in GANs design and optimization solutions proposed to handle GANs challenges. We first identify key research issues within each design and optimization technique and then propose a new taxonomy to structure solutions by key research issues. In accordance with the taxonomy, we provide a detailed discussion on different GANs variants proposed within each solution and their relationships. Finally, based on the insights gained, we present promising research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are heavily reliant upon their sensors to perfect the perception of surrounding environments, however, with the current state of technology, the data which a vehicle uses is confined to that from its own sensors. Data sharing between vehicles and/or edge servers is limited by the available network bandwidth and the stringent real-time constraints of autonomous driving applications. To address these issues, we propose a point cloud feature based cooperative perception framework (F-Cooper) for connected autonomous vehicles to achieve a better object detection precision. Not only will feature based data be sufficient for the training process, we also use the features' intrinsically small size to achieve real-time edge computing, without running the risk of congesting the network. Our experiment results show that by fusing features, we are able to achieve a better object detection result, around 10\% improvement for detection within 20 meters and 30\% for further distances, as well as achieve faster edge computing with a low communication delay, requiring 71 milliseconds in certain feature selections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce feature-level data fusion to connected autonomous vehicles for the purpose of enhancing object detection and making real-time edge computing on inter-vehicle data feasible for autonomous vehicles.},

	abstract = {Libraries, manufacturing lines, and offices of the future all stand to benefit from knowing the exact spatial order of RFID-tagged books, components, and folders, respectively. To this end, radio-based localization has demonstrated the potential for high accuracy. Key enabling ideas include motion-based synthetic aperture radar, multipath detection, and the use of different frequencies (channels). But indoors in real-world situations, current systems often fall short of the mark, mainly because of the prevalence and strength of multipath reflections of the radio signal off nearby objects. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of MobiTagbot, an autonomous wheeled robot reader that conducts a roving survey of the above such areas to achieve an exact spatial order of RFID-tagged objects in very close (1–6 cm) spacings. Our approach leverages a serendipitous correlation between the changes in multipath reflections that occur with motion and the effect of changing the carrier frequency (channel) of the RFID query. By carefully observing the relationship between channel and phase, MobiTagbot detects if multipath is likely prevalent at a given robot reader location. If so, MobiTagbot excludes phase readings from that reader location, and generates a final location estimate using phase readings from other locations as the robot reader moves in space. Experimentally, we demonstrate that cutting-edge localization algorithms including Tagoram are not accurate enough to exactly order items in very close proximity, but MobiTagbot is, achieving nearly 100\% ordering accuracy for items at low (3–6 cm) spacings and 86\% accuracy for items at very low (1–3 cm) spacings.},

Existing systems often leverage simple turn-taking between the writer and the AI in story development. However, writers remain unsupported in intuitively understanding the AI’s actions or steering the iterative generation. We introduce TaleBrush, a generative story ideation tool that uses line sketching interactions with a GPT-based language model for control and sensemaking of a protagonist’s fortune in co-created stories. Our empirical evaluation found our pipeline reliably controls story generation while maintaining the novelty of generated sentences. In a user study with 14 participants with diverse writing experiences, we found participants successfully leveraged sketching to iteratively explore and write stories according to their intentions about the character’s fortune while taking inspiration from generated stories. We conclude with a reflection on how sketching interactions can facilitate the iterative human-AI co-creation process.},

We propose Sirius, an optically-switched network for datacenters providing the abstraction of a single, high-radix switch that can connect thousands of nodes—racks or servers—in a datacenter while achieving nanosecond-granularity reconfiguration. At its core, Sirius uses a combination of tunable lasers and simple, passive gratings that route light based on its wavelength. Sirius' switching technology and topology is tightly codesigned with its routing and scheduling and with novel congestion-control and time-synchronization mechanisms to achieve a scalable yet flat network that can offer high bandwidth and very low end-to-end latency. Through a small-scale prototype using a custom tunable laser chip that can tune in less than 912 ps, we demonstrate 3.84 ns end-to-end reconfiguration atop 50 Gbps channels. Through large-scale simulations, we show that Sirius can approximate the performance of an ideal, electrically-switched non-blocking network with up to 74-77\% lower power.},

	abstract = {The seismocardiogram (SCG) is a recording of a human heart's mechanical activity. It captures fine-grained cardiovascular events such as the opening and closing of heart valves and the contraction and relaxation of heart chambers. Today, SCG recordings are obtained by strapping an accelerometer at the apex of the heart to measure chest wall vibrations. These recordings can be used to diagnose and monitor various cardiovascular conditions including myocardial infarction (heart attack), coronary heart disease, and ischemia.This paper introduces RF-SCG, a system that can capture SCG recordings without requiring any contact with the human body. The system operates by analyzing the reflections of millimeter-wave radar signals off the human body. RF-SCG can reconstruct the SCG waveform, and it can time 5 cardiovascular events within individual heartbeats with high accuracy. Our design is based on a hybrid architecture that combines signal processing with deep learning. The pipeline includes a 4D Cardiac Beamformer that can focus on the reflections of the human heart and a deep learning pipeline (RF-to-SCG Translator) that can transform these reflections into SCG waveforms. Empirical evaluation with 40,000 heartbeats from 21 healthy subjects demonstrates RF-SCG's ability to robustly time five key cardiovascular events (aortic valve opening, aortic valve closing, mitral valve opening, mitral valve closing, and isovolumetric contraction) with a median error between 0.26\%-1.29\%.},

Traditional approaches rely on direct and distributed sensing, most often by measuring one particular aspect of an environment with a special purpose sensor.

In this work, we explore the notion of general purpose sensing, wherein a single enhanced sensor can indirectly monitor a large context, without direct instrumentation of objects. Further, through what we call Synthetic Sensors, we can virtualize raw sensor data into actionable feeds, whilst simultaneously mitigating immediate privacy issues. A series of structured, formative studies informed the development of our new sensor hardware and accompanying information architecture. We deployed our system across many months and environments, the results of which show the versatility, accuracy and potential utility of our approach.},

These devices operate intermittently because of unpredictable, dynamic energy harvesting environments, failing when energy is scarce. Despite this dynamic operation, current programming models are static; they ignore the event-driven and time-sensitive nature of sensing applications, focusing only on preserving forward progress while maintaining performance. This paper proposes InK; the first reactive kernel that provides a novel way to program these tiny energy harvesting devices that focuses on their main application of event-driven sensing. InK brings an event-driven paradigm shift for batteryless applications, introducing building blocks and abstractions that enable reacting to changes in available energy and variations in sensing data, alongside task scheduling, while maintaining a consistent memory and sense of time. We implemented several event-driven applications for InK, conducted a user study, and benchmarked InK against the state-of-the-art; InK provides up to 14 times more responsiveness and was easier to use. We show that InK enables never before seen batteryless applications, and facilitates more sophisticated batteryless programs.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone.},

We show that unlocking this potential is non-trivial: such constellations provide inherently variable connectivity, which today's Internet is ill-suited to accommodate. We therefore study cost-performance tradeoffs in the design space for Internet routing that incorporates satellite connectivity examining four solutions ranging from naively using BGP to an ideal, clean-slate design. We find that the optimal solution is provided by a path-aware networking architecture in which end-hosts obtain information and control over network paths.

WideSee presents solutions across software and hardware to overcome two aspects of challenges for wide-range contactless sensing: (i) the interference brought by the device mobility and LoRa's high sensitivity; and (ii) the ambiguous target information such as location when employing just a single pair of transceivers.

For adding circuits on such stretchable cut patterns, we contribute routing strategies and a real-time routing algorithm. An interactive design tool assists designers by automatically generating patterns and circuits from a high-level specification of the desired interface. The approach is compatible with off-the-shelf materials and can realize transparent interfaces.

	abstract = {Ubiquitous finger motion tracking enables a number of exciting applications in augmented reality, sports analytics, rehabilitation-healthcare, haptics etc. This paper presents NeuroPose, a system that shows the feasibility of 3D finger motion tracking using a platform of wearable ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) sensors. EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24° and a 90\%-ile error of 18.33° in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low energy overhead.},

	abstract = {This paper explores software’s role in visual art production by examining how artists use and develop software. We conducted interviews with professional artists who were collaborating with software developers, learning software development, and building and maintaining software. We found artists were motivated to learn software development for intellectual growth and access to technical communities. Artists valued efficient workflows through skilled manual execution and personal software development, but avoided high-level forms of software automation. Artists identified conflicts between their priorities and those of professional developers and computational art communities, which influenced how they used computational aesthetics in their work. These findings contribute to efforts in systems engineering research to integrate end-user programming and creativity support across software and physical media, suggesting opportunities for artists as collaborators. Artists’ experiences writing software can guide technical implementations of domain-specific representations, and their experiences in interdisciplinary production can aid inclusive community building around computational tools.},

	abstract = {Voice interfaces are increasingly becoming integrated into a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Such systems can dramatically simplify interactions between users and devices with limited displays. Unfortunately voice interfaces also create new opportunities for exploitation. Specifically any sound-emitting device within range of the system implementing the voice interface (e.g., a smart television, an Internet-connected appliance, etc) can potentially cause these systems to perform operations against the desires of their owners (e.g., unlock doors, make unauthorized purchases, etc). We address this problem by developing a technique to recognize fundamental differences in audio created by humans and electronic speakers. We identify sub-bass over-excitation, or the presence of significant low frequency signals that are outside of the range of human voices but inherent to the design of modern speakers, as a strong differentiator between these two sources. After identifying this phenomenon, we demonstrate its use in preventing adversarial requests, replayed audio, and hidden commands with a 100\%/1.72\% TPR/FPR in quiet environments. In so doing, we demonstrate that commands injected via nearby audio devices can be effectively removed by voice interfaces.},

This practice can create dangerous situations and compromise data center availability if the designed power capacity is exceeded. This paper demonstrates that current safeguards are vulnerable to well-timed power attacks launched by malicious tenants (i.e., attackers). Further, we demonstrate that there is a physical side channel — a thermal side channel due to hot air recirculation — that contains information about the benign tenants' runtime power usage and can enable a malicious tenant to time power attacks effectively. In particular, we design a state-augmented Kalman filter to extract this information from the side channel and guide an attacker to use its maximum power at moments that coincide with the benign tenants' high power demand, thus overloading the shared power capacity. Our experimental results show that an attacker can capture 54\% of all attack opportunities, significantly compromising the data center availability. Finally, we discuss a set of possible defense strategies to safeguard the data center infrastructure against power attacks.},

Rendering new text in someone’s handwriting is difficult because natural handwriting is highly variable, yet follows both intentional and involuntary structure that makes a person’s style self-consistent. The variability means that naive example-based texture synthesis can be conspicuously repetitive.We propose an algorithm that renders a desired input string in an author’s handwriting. An annotated sample of the author’s handwriting is required; the system is flexible enough that historical documents can usually be used with only a little extra effort. Experiments show that our glyph-centric approach, with learned parameters for spacing, line thickness, and pressure, produces novel images of handwriting that look hand-made to casual observers, even when printed on paper.},

This paper presents a new development environment designed to illuminate the boundary between embedded code and circuits. Bifröst automatically instruments and captures the progress of the user's code, variable values, and the electrical and bus activity occurring at the interface between the processor and the circuit it operates in. This data is displayed in a linked visualization that allows navigation through time and program execution, enabling comparisons between variables in code and signals in circuits. Automatic checks can detect low-level hardware configuration and protocol issues, while user-authored checks can test particular application semantics.

Our first contribution is a low-cost fabrication pipeline to embed multiple aligned conductive layers with complex geometries into silicone compounds. Overlapping conductive areas from separate layers form local capacitors that measure dense area changes. Contrary to existing fabrication methods, the proposed technique only requires hardware that is readily available in modern fablabs. While area measurements alone are not enough to reconstruct the full 3D deformation of a surface, they become sufficient when paired with a data-driven prior. A novel semi-automatic tracking algorithm, based on an elastic surface geometry deformation, allows us to capture ground-truth data with an optical mocap system, even under heavy occlusions or partially unobservable markers. The resulting dataset is used to train a regressor based on deep neural networks, directly mapping the area readings to global positions of surface vertices. We demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of the proposed hardware and software in a series of controlled experiments and design a prototype of wearable wrist, elbow, and biceps sensors, which do not require line-of-sight and can be worn below regular clothing.},

We implement and evaluate three intermittent learning applications that learn the 1) air quality, 2) human presence, and 3) vibration using solar, RF, and kinetic energy harvesters, respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the energy efficiency of a learner by up to 100\% and cuts down the number of learning examples by up to 50\% when compared to state-of-the-art intermittent computing systems that do not implement the proposed intermittent learning framework.},

While there have been numerous reports on smartphone overheating, a systematic measurement and user experience study on the thermal aspect of smartphones is missing. Using thermal imaging cameras, we measure and analyze the temperatures of various smartphones running diverse application workloads such as voice calling, video recording, video chatting, and 3D online gaming. Our experiments show that running popular applications such as video chat, could raise the smartphone's surface temperature to over 50{\textasciicircum}circC in only 10 minutes, which could easily cause thermal pain to users. Recent ubiquitous scenarios such as augmented reality and mobile deep learning also have considerable thermal issues. We then perform a user study to examine when the users perceive heat discomfort from the smartphones and how they react to overheating. Most of our user study participants reported considerable thermal discomfort while playing a mobile game, and that overheating disrupted interaction flows. With this in mind, we devise a smartphone surface temperature prediction model, by using only system statistics and internal sensor values. Our evaluation showed high prediction accuracy with root-mean-square errors of less than 2{\textasciicircum}circC. We discuss several insights from our findings and recommendations for user experience, OS design, and developer support for better user-thermal interactions.},

This technology comes in many varieties, all of which aim to save time, labor, and supplies by performing lab protocol steps typically done by a technician. However, existing microfluidic platforms remain some combination of inflexible, error-prone, prohibitively expensive, and difficult to program. We address these concerns with a full-stack digital microfluidic automation platform. Our main contribution is a runtime system that provides a high-level API for microfluidic manipulations. It manages fluidic resources dynamically, allowing programmers to freely mix regular computation with microfluidics, which results in more expressive programs than previous work. It also provides real-time error correction through a computer vision system, allowing robust execution on cheaper microfluidic hardware. We implement our stack on top of a low-cost droplet microfluidic device that we have developed. We evaluate our system with the fully-automated execution of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a DNA sequencing preparation protocol. These protocols demonstrate high-level programs that combine computational and fluidic operations such as input/output of reagents, heating of samples, and data analysis. We also evaluate the impact of automatic error correction on our system's reliability.},

	abstract = {Prototyping electronic circuits is an increasingly popular activity, supported by researchers, who develop toolkits to improve the design, debugging, and fabrication of electronics. Although past work mainly dealt with circuit topology, in this paper we propose a system for determining or tuning the values of the circuit components. Based on the results of a formative study with seventeen makers, we designed VirtualComponent, a mixed-reality tool that allows users to digitally place electronic components on a real breadboard, tune their values in software, and see these changes applied to the physical circuit in real-time. VirtualComponent is composed of a set of plug-and-play modules containing banks of components, and a custom breadboard managing the connections and components' values. Through demonstrations and the results of an informal study with twelve makers, we show that VirtualComponent is easy to use and allows users to test components' value configurations with little effort.},

KnitDermis interfaces take advantage of machine knitting’s shaping properties which allow it to generate slim, stretchable, and versatile forms that can conform to underexplored body locations, such as protruded joints and convex body locations. We introduce a fabrication approach and a series of case studies to design a wide range of form factors, textures, and tactile patterns, including compression, pinching, brushing, and twisting.

While OSes and applications have evolved tremendously over the last 25 years, POSIX, and the basic set of abstractions it provides, has remained largely unchanged. Little has been done to measure how and to what extent traditional POSIX abstractions are being used in modern OSes, and whether new abstractions are taking form, dethroning traditional ones. We explore these questions through a study of POSIX usage in modern desktop and mobile OSes: Android, OS X, and Ubuntu. Our results show that new abstractions are taking form, replacing several prominent traditional abstractions in POSIX. While the changes are driven by common needs and are conceptually similar across the three OSes, they are not converging on any new standard, increasing fragmentation.},

However, within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), its use remains underexplored, in particular in Tangible User Interface (TUI). In this paper, we explore two research questions with radar as a platform for sensing tangible interaction with the counting, ordering, identification of objects and tracking the orientation, movement and distance of these objects. We detail the design space and practical use-cases for such interaction which allows us to identify a series of design patterns, beyond static interaction, which are continuous and dynamic. With a focus on planar objects, we report on a series of studies which demonstrate the suitability of this approach. This exploration is grounded in both a characterization of the radar sensing and our rigorous experiments which show that such sensing is accurate with minimal training. With these techniques, we envision both realistic and future applications and scenarios. The motivation for what we refer to as Solinteraction, is to demonstrate the potential for radar-based interaction with objects in HCI and TUI.},

	abstract = {High-precision tracking of a pen-like instrument's movements is desirable in a wide range of fields spanning education, robotics, and art, to name a few. The key challenge in doing so stems from the impracticality of embedding electronics in the tip of such instruments (a pen, marker, scalpel, etc.) as well as the difficulties in instrumenting the surface that it works on. In this paper, we present ITrackU, a movement digitization system that does not require modifications to the surface or the tracked instrument's tip. ITrackU fuses locations obtained using ultra-wideband radios (UWB), with an inertial and magnetic unit (IMU) and a pressure sensor, yielding multidimensional improvements in accuracy, range, cost, and robustness, over existing works. ITrackU embeds a micro-transmitter at the base of a pen which creates a trackable beacon, that is localized from the corners of a writing surface. Fused with inertial motion sensor and a pressure sensor, ITrackU enables accurate tracking. Our prototype of ITrackU covers a large 2.5m × 2m area, while obtaining around 2.9mm median error. We demonstrate the accuracy of our system by drawing numerous shapes and characters on a whiteboard, and compare them against a touchscreen and a camera-based ground-truthing system. Finally, the produced stream of digitized data is minuscule in volume, when compared with a video of the whiteboard, which saves both network bandwidth and storage space.},

Our key insight is to build a statistical model that correlates all specifications hidden inside a corpus with the syntax and observed behavior of programs that implement these specifications. During the analysis of a particular program, this model is conditioned into a posterior distribution that prioritizes specifications that are relevant to the program. The problem of finding anomalies is now framed quantitatively, as a problem of computing a distance between a "reference distribution" over program behaviors that our model expects from the program, and the distribution over behaviors that the program actually produces. We implement our ideas in a system, called Salento, for finding anomalous API usage in Android programs. Salento learns specifications using a combination of a topic model and a neural network model. Our encouraging experimental results show that the system can automatically discover subtle errors in Android applications in the wild, and has high precision and recall compared to competing probabilistic approaches.},

We studied the relationship between sensorial pleasantness of a meeting's room and the meeting's productivity. By administering a 28-item questionnaire to 363 online participants, we indeed found that three factors captured 62\% of people's experience of meetings: (a) productivity; (b) psychological safety; and (c) room pleasantness. To measure room pleasantness, we developed and deployed ComFeel, an indoor environmental sensing infrastructure, which captures light, temperature, and gas resistance readings through miniaturized and unobtrusive devices we built and named 'Geckos'. Across 29 real-world meetings, using ComFeel, we collected 1373 minutes of readings. For each of these meetings, we also collected whether each participant felt the meeting to have been productive, the setting to be psychologically safe, and the meeting room to be pleasant. As one expects, we found that, on average, the probability of a meeting being productive increased by 35\% for each standard deviation increase in the psychological safety participants experienced. Importantly, that probability increased by as much as 25\% for each increase in room pleasantness, confirming the significant short-term impact of the indoor environment on meetings' productivity.},

However, existing prefetchers can only target premeditated patterns and relations they were designed to handle and are unable to capture access patterns in which they do not specialize. In this article, we propose a context-based neural network (NN) prefetcher that dynamically adapts to arbitrary memory access patterns. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning, the proposed NN prefetcher correlates program and machine contextual information with memory accesses patterns, using online-training to identify and dynamically adapt to unique access patterns exhibited by the code. By targeting semantic locality in this manner, the prefetcher can discern the useful context attributes and learn to predict previously undetected access patterns, even within noisy memory access streams. We further present an architectural implementation of our NN prefetcher, explore its power, energy, and area limitations, and propose several optimizations. We evaluate the neural network prefetcher over SPEC2006, Graph500, and several microbenchmarks and show that the prefetcher can deliver an average speedup of 21.3\% for SPEC2006 (up to 2.3×) and up to 4.4× on kernels over a baseline of PC-based stride prefetcher and 30\% for SPEC2006 over a baseline with no prefetching.},

Numerous easy-to-access and easy-to-use tools have streamlined the prototyping of interactive and embedded devices for experts and led to a remarkable growth in non-expert builders. However, there has been little exploration of challenges associated with moving beyond a prototype and creating hundreds or thousands of exact replicas - a process that is still challenging for many. We interviewed 25 individuals with experience taking prototype hardware devices into low volume production. We systematically investigated the common issues faced and mitigation strategies adopted. We present our findings in four main categories: (1) gaps in technical knowledge; (2) gaps in non-technical knowledge; (3) minimum viable rigor in manufacturing preparation; and (4) building relationships and a professional network. Our study unearthed several opportunities for new tools and processes to support the transition beyond a working prototype to cost effective low-volume manufacturing. These would complement the aforementioned tools and materials that support design and prototyping.},

	abstract = {With smartphones' omnipresence in people's pockets, Machine Learning (ML) on mobile is gaining traction as devices become more powerful. With applications ranging from visual filters to voice assistants, intelligence on mobile comes in many forms and facets. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference remains a compute intensive workload, with devices struggling to support intelligence at the cost of responsiveness. On the one hand, there is significant research on reducing model runtime requirements and supporting deployment on embedded devices. On the other hand, the strive to maximise the accuracy of a task is supported by deeper and wider neural networks, making mobile deployment of state-of-the-art DNNs a moving target.In this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild in an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely deployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in the Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across devices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations. Simultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost dimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have developed gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and analysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and platforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep learning deployments on smartphones and indicate their popularity across app developers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and real-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning models in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Music plays an important role in our daily life. With the development of deep learning and modern generation techniques, researchers have done plenty of works on automatic music generation. However, due to the special requirements of both melody and arrangement, most of these methods have limitations when applying to multi-track music generation. Some critical factors related to the quality of music are not well addressed, such as chord progression, rhythm pattern, and musical style. In order to tackle the problems and ensure the harmony of multi-track music, in this article, we propose an end-to-end melody and arrangement generation framework to generate a melody track with several accompany tracks played by some different instruments. To be specific, we first develop a novel Chord based Rhythm and Melody Cross-Generation Model to generate melody with a chord progression. Then, we propose a Multi-Instrument Co-Arrangement Model based on multi-task learning for multi-track music arrangement. Furthermore, to control the musical style of arrangement, we design a Multi-Style Multi-Instrument Co-Arrangement Model to learn the musical style with adversarial training. Therefore, we can not only maintain the harmony of the generated music but also control the musical style for better utilization. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed models.},

In this study, we evaluate the robustness to home laundering of a previously-developed cut-and-sew technique for assembling e-textile circuits. Alternative surface insulation materials, textile substrate properties, and soldered component joints are evaluated. After around 1000 minutes (16.67 hours) of rigorous washing and drying, we measured a best-case 0\% failure rate for component solder joints, and a best-case 0.38 ohm/m maximum increase in trace resistance. Liquid silicone seam sealer was effective in protecting 100\% of solder joints. Two tape-type alternative surface insulation materials were effective in protecting bare traces and component attachment points respectively. Overall, results demonstrate the feasibility of producing insulated, washable cut-and-sew circuits for smart garment manufacturing.},

Historically, systems measuring interactions have been forced to choose between deployability and measurement fidelity—they operate only in instrumented spaces, under line-of-sight conditions, or provide coarse-grained proximity data. We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.},

However, while HCI research on wearable typing is diverse, existing work focuses on stationary scenarios and fine-grained input that will likely perform poorly when users are on-the-go. To address this issue we explore single-handed wearable typing using intra-hand touches between the thumb and fingers, a modality we argue will be robust to the physical disturbances inherent to input while mobile. We first examine the impact of walking on performance of these touches, noting no significant differences in accuracy or speed, then feed our study data into a multi-objective optimization process in order to design keyboard layouts (for both five and ten keys) capable of supporting rapid, accurate, comfortable, and unambiguous typing. A final study tests these layouts against QWERTY baselines and reports performance improvements of up to 10.45\% WPM and 39.44\% WER when users type while walking.},

	abstract = {This article aims for the detection and search of events in videos, where video examples are either scarce or even absent during training. To enable such event detection and search, ImageNet concept banks have shown to be effective. Rather than employing the standard concept bank of 1,000 ImageNet classes, we leverage the full 21,841-class dataset. We identify two problems with using the full dataset: (i) there is an imbalance between the number of examples per concept, and (ii) not all concepts are equally relevant for events. In this article, we propose to balance large-scale image hierarchies for pre-training. We shuffle concepts based on bottom-up and top-down operations to overcome the problems of example imbalance and concept relevance. Using this strategy, we arrive at the shuffled ImageNet bank, a concept bank with an order of magnitude more concepts compared to standard ImageNet banks. Compared to standard ImageNet pre-training, our shuffles result in more discriminative representations to train event models from the limited video event examples. For event search, the broad range of concepts enable a closer match between textual queries of events and concept detections in videos. Experimentally, we show the benefit of the proposed bank for event detection and event search, with state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on the challenging TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Ad-Hoc Video Search benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Interactions and connectivity is increasingly expanding to shared objects and environments, such as furniture, vehicles, lighting, and entertainment systems. For transparent personalization in such contexts, we see an opportunity for embedded recognition, to complement traditional, explicit authentication. We introduce Zensei, an implicit sensing system that leverages bio-sensing, signal processing and machine learning to classify uninstrumented users by their body's electrical properties. Zensei could allow many objects to recognize users. E.g., phones that unlock when held, cars that automatically adjust mirrors and seats, or power tools that restore user settings. We introduce wide-spectrum bioimpedance hardware that measures both amplitude and phase. It extends previous approaches through multi-electrode sensing and high-speed wireless data collection for embedded devices. We implement the sensing in devices and furniture, where unique electrode configurations generate characteristic profiles based on user's unique electrical properties. Finally, we discuss results from a comprehensive longitudinal 22-day data collection experiment with 46 subjects. Our analysis shows promising classification accuracy and low false acceptance rate.},

	abstract = {Context: Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge.Objective: Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors: (1) reproducibility—whether the reported experimental results can be obtained by other researchers using authors’ artifacts (i.e., source code and datasets) with the same experimental setup; and (2) replicability—whether the reported experimental result can be obtained by other researchers using their re-implemented artifacts with a different experimental setup. We observed that DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the time-consuming optimization process, unlike classical supervised machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., random forest). This study aims to investigate the urgency and importance of reproducibility and replicability for DL studies on SE tasks.Method: In this study, we conducted a literature review on 147 DL studies recently published in 20 SE venues and 20 AI (Artificial Intelligence) venues to investigate these issues. We also re-ran four representative DL models in SE to investigate important factors that may strongly affect the reproducibility and replicability of a study.Results: Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these two factors in SE, where only 10.2\% of the studies investigate any research question to show that their models can address at least one issue of replicability and/or reproducibility. More than 62.6\% of the studies do not even share high-quality source code or complete data to support the reproducibility of their complex models. Meanwhile, our experimental results show the importance of reproducibility and replicability, where the reported performance of a DL model could not be reproduced for an unstable optimization process. Replicability could be substantially compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data.Conclusion: It is urgent for the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a high-quality reproduction package, enhance DL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance sensitivity on different sampled data.},

We demonstrate three experimental milling workflows as computational notebooks, conduct a user study with practitioners with a range of backgrounds, and discuss literate programming as a future vision for digital fabrication altogether.},

To address this problem, we propose sensing techniques that transition between various nuances of mobile and stationary use via postural awareness. These postural nuances include shifting hand grips, varying screen angle and orientation, planting the palm while writing or sketching, and detecting what direction the hands approach from. To achieve this, our system combines three sensing modalities: 1) raw capacitance touchscreen images, 2) inertial motion, and 3) electric field sensors around the screen bezel for grasp and hand proximity detection. We show how these sensors enable posture-aware pen+touch techniques that adapt interaction and morph user interface elements to suit fine-grained contexts of body-, arm-, hand-, and grip-centric frames of reference.},

	abstract = {Side-channel attacks that leak sensitive information through a computing device's interaction with its physical environment have proven to be a severe threat to devices' security, particularly when adversaries have unfettered physical access to the device. Traditional approaches for leakage detection measure the physical properties of the device. Hence, they cannot be used during the design process and fail to provide root cause analysis. An alternative approach that is gaining traction is to automate leakage detection by modeling the device. The demand to understand the scope, benefits, and limitations of the proposed tools intensifies with the increase in the number of proposals. In this SoK, we classify approaches to automated leakage detection based on the model's source of truth. We classify the existing tools on two main parameters: whether the model includes measurements from a concrete device and the abstraction level of the device specification used for constructing the model. We survey the proposed tools to determine the current knowledge level across the domain and identify open problems. In particular, we highlight the absence of evaluation methodologies and metrics that would compare proposals' effectiveness from across the domain. We believe that our results help practitioners who want to use automated leakage detection and researchers interested in advancing the knowledge and improving automated leakage detection.},

Our open-ended, semi-structured interviews examine both overarching design flows and details of individual steps. One major finding was that most creative engineering work happens during system architecture, yet current tools operate at lower abstraction levels and create significant tedious work for designers. From that insight, we conceptualize abstractions and primitives for higher-level tools and elicit feedback from our participants on clickthrough mockups of design flows through an example project. We close with our observation on opportunities for improving board design tools and discuss generalizability of our findings beyond the electronics domain.},

Furthermore, because it compares the outputs from two matched noise sources, it rejects environmental disturbances like RF energy and power supply ripple.

In this article, we describe a study of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory web development course taken by both computing majors and general education students. Using data collected during the initial weeks of the course, we investigate the nature of the syntax errors they make when learning HTML and CSS, and how they resolve them. This is accomplished through the deployment of openHTML, a lightweight web-based code editor that logs user activity. Our analysis reveals that nearly all students made syntax errors that remained unresolved in their assessments, and that these errors continued weeks into the course. Approximately 20\% of these errors related to the relatively complex system of rules that dictates when it is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another. On the other hand, 35\% of errors related to the relatively simple tag syntax determining how HTML elements are nested. We also find that validation played a key role in resolving errors: While the majority of unresolved errors were present in untested code, nearly all of the errors that were detected through validation were eventually corrected. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for computing education.},

Notably, many open research questions regarding the extraction of functionally correct netlists from Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) have been tackled. In order to facilitate further analysis of recovered netlists, a software framework is required, serving as the foundation for specialized algorithms. Currently, no such framework is publicly available.Therefore, we provide the first open-source gate-library agnostic framework for gate-level netlist analysis.

We present two reflective accounts of critically-engaged RTD practices in which our attempts to articulate concerns or questions were met with resistance from technology that was both the subject and medium of our investigation. We argue that encountering inarticulacy is not a failure of RTD but instead points to how material exploration can sensitise us to how network technology resists articulating certain values or concerns. Encountering inarticulacy led us to formulate new problems and new lines of inquiry. We conclude by suggesting that the central role given to ambiguity in RTD prepares us to witness and respond to inarticulacy in our practices, design outcomes and critical understandings.},

Understanding how new storage components behave under power fault is the first step towards designing new robust storage systems.In this article, we propose a new methodology to expose reliability issues in block devices under power faults. Our framework includes specially designed hardware to inject power faults directly to devices, workloads to stress storage components, and techniques to detect various types of failures. Applying our testing framework, we test 17 commodity SSDs from six different vendors using more than three thousand fault injection cycles in total. Our experimental results reveal that 14 of the 17 tested SSD devices exhibit surprising failure behaviors under power faults, including bit corruption, shorn writes, unserializable writes, metadata corruption, and total device failure.},

As an increasing number of HAR applications are deployed in real-world environments, it is important and essential to extend the activity model to adapt to the change in people’s activity routine. Otherwise, HAR applications can become obsolete and fail to deliver activity-aware services. The existing research in HAR has focused on detecting abnormal sensor events or new activities, however, extending the activity model is currently under-explored. To directly tackle this challenge, we build on the recent advance in the area of lifelong machine learning and design a continual activity recognition system, called HAR-GAN, to grow the activity model over time. HAR-GAN does not require a prior knowledge on what new activity classes might be and it does not require to store historical data by leveraging the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate sensor data on the previously learned activities. We have evaluated HAR-GAN on four third-party, public datasets collected on binary sensors and accelerometers. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAR-GAN in continual activity recognition and shed insight on the future challenges.},

	abstract = {A new accuracy-preserving parallel algorithm employing compact schemes is presented for direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Here the connotation of accuracy preservation is having the same level of accuracy obtained by the proposed parallel compact scheme, as the sequential code with the same compact scheme. Additional loss of accuracy in parallel compact schemes arises due to necessary boundary closures at sub-domain boundaries. An attempt to circumvent this has been done in the past by the use of Schwarz domain decomposition and compact filters in “A new compact scheme for parallel computing using domain decomposition,” J. Comput. Phys. 220, 2 (2007), 654–677, where a large number of overlap points was necessary to reduce error. A parallel compact scheme with staggered grids has been used to report direct numerical simulation of transition and turbulence by the Schwarz domain decomposition method. In the present research, we propose a new parallel algorithm with two benefits. First, the number of overlap points is reduced to a single common boundary point between any two neighboring sub-domains, thereby saving the number of points used, with resultant speed-up. Second, with a proper design, errors arising due to sub-domain boundary closure schemes are reduced to a user designed error tolerance, bringing the new parallel scheme on par with sequential computing. Error reduction is achieved by using global spectral analysis, introduced in “Analysis of central and upwind compact schemes,” J. Comput. Phys. 192, 2, (2003) 677–694, which analyzes any discrete computing method in the full domain integrally. The design of the parallel compact scheme is explained, followed by a demonstration of the accuracy of the method by solving benchmark flows: (1) periodic two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex problem; (2) flow inside two-dimensional square lid-driven cavity (LDC) at high Reynolds number; and (3) flow inside a non-periodic three-dimensional cubic LDC with the staggered grid arrangement.},

	abstract = {Assembling circuits on breadboards using reference designs is a common activity among makers. While tools like Fritzing offer a simplified visualization of how components and wires are connected, such pictorial depictions of circuits are rare in formal educational materials and the vast bulk of online technical documentation. Electronic schematics are more common but are perceived as challenging and confusing by novice makers. To improve access to schematics, we propose SchemaBoard, a system for assisting makers in assembling and inspecting circuits on breadboards from schematic source materials. SchemaBoard uses an LED matrix integrated underneath a working breadboard to visualize via light patterns where and how components should be placed, or to highlight elements of circuit topology such as electrical nets and connected pins. This paper presents a formative study with 16 makers, the SchemaBoard system, and a summative evaluation with an additional 16 users. Results indicate that SchemaBoard is effective in reducing both the time and the number of errors associated with building a circuit based on a reference schematic, and for inspecting the circuit for correctness after its assembly.},

	abstract = {With the increasing commercial prospect of personal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), human and UAV interaction has been a compelling and challenging task. In this paper, we present the RFHUI, a human and UAV interaction system based on passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology which provides a remote control function. Three or more Ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID tags are attached on a board to create a hand-held controller. A COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) RFID reader with multiple antennas is deployed to collect the observations of the tags. According to the phase measurement from the RFID reader, we leverage a Bayesian filter based method to localize the position of all tags in a global coordinate. From the estimated position of the attached tags, a 6 DOF (Degrees of Freedom) pose of the controller can be obtained. Therefore, when the user moves the controller, its pose will be precisely tracked in a real-time manner. Then, the flying commands, which are generated from the estimated pose of the controller, are sent to the UAV for navigation. We implemented a prototype of the RFHUI, and the experiment results show that it provides precise poses with 0.045 m error in position and 2.5° error in orientation for the controller. It therefore enables the controller to precisely and intuitively instruct the UAV's navigation in an indoor environment.},

	abstract = {Touch-based communication offers a direct and intuitive way for users to initiate and control data transfer when using tangible and ubiquitous interfaces. However, this requires that each interactive device be instrumented with a dedicated radio transmitter, which limits many applications. While not all devices have radio hardware, all devices do emit small amounts of electromagnetic noise in the form of EMI. We argue that if properly modulated these electromagnetic emissions can be used as an untapped communication channel capable of transmitting arbitrary data.To enable this, a spread spectrum frequency shift keying modulation scheme has been developed to encode data onto the device’s EMI. When the device is touched by a user, the data encoded EMI signal travels through their body and into our custom wrist band, consisting of a single op-amp and MCU. Our results show that we are able to turn electronic primitives such as LEDs, buttons, I/O lines, LCD screens, motors and power supplies into radio transmitters capable of touch communication. Effective data rates range from 5.8Kbps to 22 bit per image depending on the primitive used. To demonstrate this new communication technique, we develop several interactive experiences where users can retrieve complex information such as the function of buttons on a device, directions embedded into a LCD screen, and simplified device pairing. Ultimately, EM-Comm enables nearly any electronic device to be turned into a touch-based radio transmitter with only a software upgrade.},

Most neurofeedback games use negative reinforcement to guide players – i.e., a barrier to progressing in the game is removed when players achieve a desirable state – which is considered to be less effective than reinforcing behaviour through positive feedback when players do well. We investigate whether using positive reinforcement is more successful than negative reinforcement through the design and evaluation of the experience and efficacy of a custom neurofeedback training game. We showed that positive reinforcement was more effective in encouraging players to keep their brain activity regulated. Furthermore it generated more positive affect and motivated more investment of effort in players, suggesting that positive reinforcement in neurofeedback games may provide a better and more effective neurofeedback training experience.},

However, treatment strategies remain limited to time-consuming manual massage by trained therapists, deterring a widely accessible approach. We present KnitDema, a robotic textile device that allows sequential compression from distal to proximal finger phalanges for mobilizing edema. We machine-knit the device and integrate small-scale actuators to envelop granular body locations such as fingers, catering to the shape of the hand. In addition, the device affords customizable compression levels through the enclosed fiber-like actuators. We characterize compression parameters and simulate the shunting of edema through a mock fluid system. Finally, we conduct a case study to evaluate the feasibility of the device, in which five hand edema patients assess KnitDema. Our study provides insights into the opportunities for robotic textiles to support personalized rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Enabling computing systems to understand user interactions with everyday surfaces and objects can drive a wide range of applications. However, existing vibration-based sensors (e.g., accelerometers) lack the sensitivity to detect light touch gestures or the bandwidth to recognize activity containing high-frequency components. Conversely, microphones are highly susceptible to environmental noise, degrading performance. Each time an object impacts a surface, Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) are generated that propagate along the air-to-surface boundary. This work repurposes a Voice PickUp Unit (VPU) to capture SAWs on surfaces (including smooth surfaces, odd geometries, and fabrics) over long distances and in noisy environments. Our custom-designed signal acquisition, processing, and machine learning pipeline demonstrates utility in both interactive and activity recognition applications, such as classifying trackpad-style gestures on a desk and recognizing 16 cooking-related activities, all with \&gt;97\% accuracy. Ultimately, SAWs offer a unique signal that can enable robust recognition of user touch and on-surface events.},

Omni enriches AR, VR and desktop applications by providing an active haptic experience using a simple apparatus centered around an electromagnetic base. The spatial haptic capabilities of Omni are enabled by a novel gradient-based method to reconstruct the 3D position of the permanent magnet in midair using the measurements from eight off-the-shelf hall sensors that are integrated into the base. Omni's 3 DoF spherical electromagnet simultaneously exerts dynamic and precise radial and tangential forces in a volumetric space around the device. Since our system is fully integrated, contains no moving parts and requires no external tracking, it is easy and affordable to fabricate. We describe Omni's hardware implementation, our 3D reconstruction algorithm, and evaluate the tracking and actuation performance in depth. Finally, we demonstrate its capabilities via a set of interactive usage scenarios.},

In machine learning research, this gradient problem lies at the core of many learning problems, in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. We will generally seek to rewrite such gradients in a form that allows for Monte Carlo estimation, allowing them to be easily and efficiently used and analysed. We explore three strategies–the pathwise, score function, and measure-valued gradient estimators– exploring their historical development, derivation, and underlying assumptions. We describe their use in other fields, show how they are related and can be combined, and expand on their possible generalisations. Wherever Monte Carlo gradient estimators have been derived and deployed in the past, important advances have followed. A deeper and more widely-held understanding of this problem will lead to further advances, and it is these advances that we wish to support.},

But this creates a problem: how can middleboxes, which employ DPI, work over HTTPS connections with encrypted traffic while preserving privacy? In this paper, we present SPABox, a middlebox-based system that supports both keyword-based and data analysis-based DPI functions over encrypted traffic. SPABox preserves privacy by using a novel protocol with a limited connection setup overhead. We implement SPABox on a standard server and show that SPABox is practical for both long-lived and short-lived connection. Compared with the state-of-the-art Blindbox system, SPABox is more than five orders of magnitude faster and requires seven orders of magnitude less bandwidth for connection setup while SPABox can achieve a higher security level.},

Nowadays, it has become more than relevant on mobile and connected devices requiring a high security level. Yet, their applicability to smartphones is not obvious, as the architecture of modern System-on-Chips (SoC) is becoming ever more complex.This paper describes how a secret AES key was retrieved from the hardware cryptoprocessor of a smartphone. It is part of an attack scenario targeting the bootloader decryption. The focus is on practical realization and the challenges it brings. In particular, catching meaningful signals emitted by the cryptoprocessor embedded in the main System-on-Chip can be troublesome. Indeed, the Package-on-Package technology makes access to the die problematic and prevents straightforward near-field electromagnetic measurements. The described scenario can apply to any device whose chain-of-trust relies on firmware encryption, such as many smartphones or Internet-of-Things nodes.},

Our findings contrast researchers’ visions of seamless farming technologies with the seamful realities of their work to produce them. We trace how, when anticipating future use, the seams that researchers themselves experience disappear, other seams are hidden from view by institutional support, and seams end users may face are too distant to be in sight. We develop suggestions for the design of these technologies grounded in a more artful management of seamfulness and seamlessness during the process of design and development.},

The median filter algorithm was used to remove the noise in the image. Logarithmic transformation was used to enhance image contrast. Sobel operator was used for edge detection to obtain the geometric center of the defect area. On this basis, the PCB image was registered by template matching method, and the difference between the preprocessed PCB image to be tested and the standard PCB image was calculated to get the difference map. Subsequently, morphological algorithm was used to remove the slight differences and obtain the defect map.

	abstract = {Transferring data between integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for an important fraction of the power dissipation in wearable and mobile systems. Reducing signal transitions reduces the dynamic power dissipated in the data transfer between ICs. Techniques such as Gray coding to reduce transitions between two parallel words cannot be applied when the signal transitions are between bits of a single serialized word.This paper introduces value-deviation-bounded serial encoding (VDBS encoding). VDBS encoding significantly reduces signal transitions between bits of a single serialized word, trading power efficiency for data accuracy. This tradeoff is worthwhile when the data are from signal sources such as sensors and destined for consumption by signal processing algorithms that are error-tolerant.We present analytic formulas for the Pareto-optimal VDBS encoders and introduce an efficient algorithm, Rake, that reduces transitions almost as much as the optimum transition-reducing encoder. We evaluate Rake by encoding data in a pedometer system and in a text-recognition system. For the pedometer, Rake reduces transitions by 54\% on average, in exchange for step count errors smaller than 5\%. For the text recognizer, Rake reduces transitions by 55\% on average, while maintaining OCR accuracy above 90 \%.},

	abstract = {The surface quality inspection of industrial printed circuit board (PCB) is a vitally important link in its manufacturing process. To inspect surface defects of PCBs effectively, the automatic optical inspection (AOI) technology, in which the PCB image acquisition depends on the path planning method, is widely adopted by industry. It is regarded as a characteristic travelling salesman problem (TSP), which includes component clustering, location adjustment and algorithm adaptation optimization. In this paper, by improving the ant colony algorithm (ACA) algorithm, we devise a PCB image acquisition path planning model and the corresponding solving algorithms. Because the ACA encounters difficulty escaping from the local optimal solution, an improved ACA with a negative feedback mechanism is proposed that is able to obtain a better tour path with a higher probability. Aiming at the uncertainty of the local location of image acquisition windows, location adjustment methods are introduced to further shorten the path length and improve the image acquisition efficiency. Finally, via simulation experiments, the proposed global negative feedback ACA (GNF-ACA) can shorten the average length of the tour path by 1.7\% without changing the time complexity. The three methods of location adjustment can further shorten the length of the tour path by 5.6\%, 13.1\% and 13.7\%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We begin by briefly identifying various challenges associated with the conventional approach, which calls for a carefully written kernel that implements complex arithmetic at the lowest possible level (i.e., assembly language). We then set out to develop a method of complex matrix multiplication that avoids the need for complex kernels altogether. This constraint promotes code reuse and portability within libraries such as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and BLAS-Like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) and allows kernel developers to focus their efforts on fewer and simpler kernels. We develop two alternative approaches—one based on the 3m method and one that reflects the classic 4m formulation—each with multiple variants, all of which rely only on real matrix multiplication kernels. We discuss the performance characteristics of these “induced” methods and observe that the assembly-level method actually resides along the 4m spectrum of algorithmic variants. Implementations are developed within the BLIS framework, and testing on modern hardware confirms that while the less numerically stable 3m method yields the fastest runtimes, the more stable (and thus widely applicable) 4m method’s performance is somewhat limited due to implementation challenges that appear inherent in nature.},

However, this has also raised major privacy and efficiency concerns that need to be addressed. While sharing clinical data across the cloud that often consists of sensitive patient-related information, privacy is a major challenge. Adequate protection of patients’ privacy helps to increase public trust in medical research. Additionally, DL-based models are complex, and in a cloud-based approach, efficient data processing in such models is complicated. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and secure cancer diagnostic framework for histopathological image classification by utilizing both differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. For efficient computation, instead of performing the whole operation on the cloud, we decouple the layers into two modules: one for feature extraction using the VGGNet module at the user side and the remaining layers for private prediction over the cloud. The efficacy of the framework is validated on two datasets composed of histopathological images of the canine mammary tumor and human breast cancer. The application of differential privacy preserving to the proposed model makes the model secure and capable of preserving the privacy of sensitive data from any adversary, without significantly compromising the model accuracy. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model efficiently achieves the trade-off between privacy and model performance.},

A locally Flexible Manufacturing Cell (FMC) or Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) is an artificial intelligence (AI) composite structure where sensors and actuators (small devices compared to the involved AOI FMC system) interact with the hosting media, creating PCBs gaps imaging as a coupled effect of AOI algorithms and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) in the FCM structure. This effect typically creates imaging gaps at lower frequencies than those that would be observed in the PCBs. An introduction about colored PCBs electronic components background modeling, Kernel methods, multi-model algorithms, Kalman filters, and Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) is given.

The automation of production lines implies profitability and product quality. Moreover, optimized human resources result in process optimization and production increase. This work addresses the problem of optimizing the glue tube replacement in Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) manufacturing, warning a human operator only just in time to replace the glue tube. We propose an approach to estimate the glue level, in the glue injection process, during PCB manufacturing. The proposed methodology is composed of three main steps: i) Pre-Processing; ii) Feature extraction; and iii) Glue level estimation through machine learning. The proposed predictive model learns the relation between visual features and the glue level in the tube. Real and simulated experiments were carried out to validate the proposed approach. Results show the obtained Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measure of 0.88, using Random Forest regression model. Furthermore, the proposed approach presents high accuracy even regarding noisy images, resulting in RMSE measures of 3.64 and 4.15 for a Salt and Pepper and Gaussian noise, respectively.

This work optimizes indoor coverage with LAVA, a Large Array of Vanilla Amplifiers. LAVA is a standard-agnostic cooperative mesh of elements, i.e., RF devices each consisting of several switched input and output antennas connected to fixed-gain amplifiers. Each LAVA element is further equipped with rudimentary power sensing to detect nearby transmissions. The elements report power readings to the LAVA control plane, which then infers active link sessions without explicitly interacting with the endpoint transmitter or receiver. With simple on-off control of amplifiers and antenna switching, LAVA boosts passing signals via multi hop amplify-and-forward. LAVA explores a middle ground between smart surfaces and physical-layer relays. Multi-hopping over short inter-hop distances exerts more control over the end-to-end trajectory, supporting fine-grained coverage and spatial reuse. Ceiling testbed results show throughput improvements to individual Wi-Fi links by 50\% on average and up to 100\% at 15 dBm transmit power (193\% on average, up to 8x at 0 dBm). ZigBee links see up to 17 dB power gain. For pairs of co-channel concurrent links, LAVA provides average per-link throughput improvements of 517\% at 0 dBm and 80\% at 15 dBm.},

Exploiting machine vision for specific technological applications became an essential opportunity to introduce significant improvements in the manufacturing context. This paper proposes a study to analyze the ML capabilities to perform Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) for quality control in the manufacturing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). The study has been performed by testing Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8 algorithms and an open-source PCB dataset designed to evaluate other ML techniques. The chosen open-source dataset (i.e. PCB defect dataset released by Open Lab on Human–Robot Interaction of Peking University, HRIPCB) individuates appropriate classes of products and related defects for the context of interest, resulting in a suitable dataset for the performance evaluation of tested algorithms. The challenge of this specific application is the recognition of the component boundaries that have submillimetric dimensions and are not clearly identifiable. The comparison between Mask R-CNN and YOLOv8 highlights that the Mask R-CNN performs better in defect detection (i.e., Missing Holes and Shorts). In particular, for the missing hole defects, for example, the mAP50-95 is 0.798 for Mask R-CNN and 0.261 for YOLOv8. Instead, for the short defects, mAP50-95 is 0.519 for Mask R-CNN and 0.399 for YOLOv8.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown superior image data augmentation performance, but their suitability in gesture synthesis has received inadequate attention. Further, GANs prohibitively require simultaneous generator and discriminator network training. We tackle both issues in this work. We first discuss a novel, device-agnostic GAN model for gesture synthesis called DeepGAN. Thereafter, we formulate DeepNAG by introducing a new differentiable loss function based on dynamic time warping and the average Hausdorff distance, which allows us to train DeepGAN’s generator without requiring a discriminator. Through evaluations, we compare the utility of DeepGAN and DeepNAG against two alternative techniques for training five recognizers using data augmentation over six datasets. We further investigate the perceived quality of synthesized samples via an Amazon Mechanical Turk user study based on the HYPE∞\&nbsp;benchmark. We find that DeepNAG outperforms DeepGAN in accuracy, training time (up to 17 × faster), and realism, thereby opening the door to a new line of research in generator network design and training for gesture synthesis.

	abstract = {Deep learning with edge computing arises as a popular paradigm for powering edge devices with intelligence. As the size of deep neural networks (DNN) continually increases, model quantization, which converts the full-precision model into lower-bit representation while mostly preserving the accuracy, becomes a prerequisite for deploying a well-trained DNN on resource-limited edge devices. However, to properly quantize a DNN requires an essential amount of expert knowledge, or otherwise the model accuracy would be devastatingly affected. Alternatively, recent years witness the birth of third-party model supply chains which provide pretrained quantized neural networks (QNN) for free downloading. In this paper, we systematically analyze the potential threats of trojaned models in third-party QNN supply chains. For the first time, we describe and implement a QUAntization-SpecIfic backdoor attack (QUASI), which manipulates the quantization mechanism to inject a backdoor specific to the quantized model. In other words, the attacker-specified inputs, or triggers, would not cause misbehaviors of the trojaned model in full precision until the backdoor function is automatically completed by a normal quantization operation, producing a trojaned QNN which can be triggered with a near 100\% success rate. Our proposed QUASI attack reveals several key vulnerabilities in the existing QNN supply chains: (i) QUASI demonstrates a third-party QNN released online can also be injected with backdoors, while, unlike full-precision models, there is almost no working algorithm for checking the fidelity of a QNN. (ii) More threateningly, the backdoor injected by QUASI remains inactivated in the full-precision model, which inhibits model consumers from attributing undergoing trojan attacks to the malicious model provider. As a practical implication, we alarm it can be highly risky to accept and deploy third-party QNN on edge devices at the current stage, if without future mitigation studies.},

We present the results of an initial in-lab pilot study designed with our industry collaborators. In our pilot, a humanoid robot visually inspected participants' assembled products in a shared workspace and provided critiques that follow simple models of robotic social feedback. Our findings suggest that people's opinions of the robot (trust, impression of intelligence, etc.) changed based on the robot's social behaviors while it is judging the participant's work. Additionally, people rated the robot more negatively if they disagreed with the robot's opinions of their work, regardless of the robot social behavior and the value of its critique.},

	abstract = {This paper explores building an ultra-low latency and high-accuracy location tracking solution using battery-free tags. While there is rich prior work on location tracking with battery-free RFID tags and backscatter devices, these systems typically face tradeoffs with accuracy, power consumption, and latency. Such limitations make these existing solutions unsuitable for emerging applications like industrial augmented reality which requires tracking fast-moving machinery; monitoring indoor sports activities that require real-time tracking of fast-moving objects with high precision and under stringent latency constraints.We propose and demonstrate FastLoc, a precision tracking system that locates tiny, battery-free analog backscatter tags at sub-millisecond latency and sub-centimeter accuracy. FastLoc is a hybrid system that simultaneously uses RF and optical signals to track tiny tags that can be attached to everyday objects. FastLoc leverages the RF channel responses from tags for estimating the coarse region where the tags may be located. It simultaneously uses the sensed optical information modulated on the backscatter signals to enable fine-grained location estimation within the coarse region. To achieve this, we design and fabricate a custom analog tag that consumes less than 150 uW and instantaneously converts incident optical signals to one-shot wideband harmonic RF responses at nanosecond latency. We then develop a static high-density distributed-frequency structured light pattern that can localize tags in the area of interest at a sub-centimeter accuracy and microsecond-scale latency. A detailed experimental evaluation of FastLoc shows a median accuracy of 0.7 cm in tag localization with a 0.51 ms effective localization latency.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid development of manufacturing capabilities and the general improvement in requirements for product quality, the role of quality inspection in the industrial production process is becoming increasingly important. Unlike the case for natural objects, detailed information is particularly crucial in defect classification and localization, resulting in poor performance of general object detectors on complex defect detection tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a progressively refined redistribution pyramid network for visual defect detection in complex images, in which three novel components are designed. (1) The aligned dense feature pyramid network (AD-FPN) refines scale differences and performs efficient alignment, alleviating feature misalignment in FPN-based methods. (2) The phase-wise feature redistribution module (PFRM) enhances the interaction between features across layers, where global information is reassigned in a semantically adaptive manner. (3) The adaptive feature purification module (AFPM) helps the network distinguish defects from complex backgrounds, and its update is directly supervised by an auxiliary branch to accelerate convergence. These ideas are all implemented based on YOLOv5. Extensive experiments on the Tianchi fabric dataset, the publicly available surface defect dataset NEU-DET, and the PCB defect dataset show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art defect detection methods on most evaluation metrics. In addition, experimental results on the remote sensing dataset RSOD and pothole image dataset also demonstrate the strong generalization ability of our method in other complex scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In many distributed wireless surveillance applications, compressed videos are used for performing automatic video analysis tasks. The accuracy of object detection, which is essential for various video analysis tasks, can be reduced due to video quality degradation caused by lossy compression. This article introduces a video encoding framework with the objective of boosting the accuracy of object detection for wireless surveillance applications. The proposed video encoding framework is based on systematic investigation of the effects of lossy compression on object detection. It has been found that current standardized video encoding schemes cause temporal domain fluctuation for encoded blocks in stable background areas and spatial texture degradation for encoded blocks in dynamic foreground areas of a raw video, both of which degrade the accuracy of object detection. Two measures, the sum-of-absolute frame difference (SFD) and the degradation of texture in 2D transform domain (TXD), are introduced to depict the temporal domain fluctuation and the spatial texture degradation in an encoded video, respectively. The proposed encoding framework is designed to suppress unnecessary temporal fluctuation in stable background areas and preserve spatial texture in dynamic foreground areas based on the two measures, and it introduces new mode decision strategies for both intra- and interframes to improve the accuracy of object detection while maintaining an acceptable rate distortion performance. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional encoding schemes, the proposed scheme improves the performance of object detection and results in lower bit rates and significantly reduced complexity with comparable quality in terms of PSNR and SSIM.},

This has led the electronics industry to seek improvements in their inspection processes, often making it necessary to increase the level of automation on the production line. The use of machine vision for quality inspection within manufacturing processes has increasingly supported decision making in the approval or rejection of products outside of the established quality standards. This study proposes a hybrid smart-vision inspection system with a machine vision concept and vision sensor equipment to verify 24 components and eight screw threads. The goal of this study is to increase automated inspection reliability and reduce non-conformity rates in the manufacturing process on the assembly line of automotive products using machine vision. The system uses a camera to collect real-time images of the assembly fixtures, which are connected to a CMOS color vision sensor. The method is highly accurate in complex industry environments and exhibits specific feasibility and effectiveness. The results indicate high performance in the failure mode defined during this study, obtaining the best inspection performance through a strategy using Vision Builder for automated inspection. This approach reduced the action priority by improving the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method. © 2025 by the authors.},

Our approach provides two contributions to reconstruct a restoration with a smooth join to the broken object, necessary for object functionality such as liquid containment, injury prevention, and visual aesthetic. As our first contribution, we leverage the original counterpart mesh to grow an exterior surface for the restoration piece that approaches the broken object within a small tolerance. As our second contribution, we project the exterior surface boundary onto the broken object to create a fracture surface boundary whose vertices satisfy the constraints of proximity, normal alignment, and tangency to vertices on the exterior surface boundary. Our approach prevents artifacts of volumetric Boolean subtraction, such as floating components and thin long slivers at the join, and avoids ruts at the join region introduced by Euclidean distance thresholding. We show 3D printed restoration results for 14 objects and 3D printable results for 8 objects.},

	abstract = {While the move to smaller transistors has been a boon for performance it has dramatically increased the cost to fabricate chips using those smaller transistors. This forces the vast majority of chip design companies to trust a third party—often overseas—to fabricate their design. To guard against shipping chips with errors (intentional or otherwise) chip design companies rely on post-fabrication testing. Unfortunately, this type of testing leaves the door open to malicious modifications since attackers can craft attack triggers requiring a sequence of unlikely events, which will never be encountered by even the most diligent tester. In this paper, we show how a fabrication-time attacker can leverage analog circuits to create a hardware attack that is small (i.e., requires as little as one gate) and stealthy (i.e., requires an unlikely trigger sequence before affecting a chip's functionality). In the open spaces of an already placed and routed design, we construct a circuit that uses capacitors to siphon charge from nearby wires as they transit between digital values. When the capacitors are fully charged, they deploy an attack that forces a victim flip-flop to a desired value. We weaponize this attack into a remotely controllable privilege escalation by attaching the capacitor to a controllable wire and by selecting a victim flip-flop that holds the privilege bit for our processor. We implement this attack in an OR1200 processor and fabricate a chip. Experimental results show that the purposed attack works. It eludes activation by a diverse set of benchmarks and evades known defenses.},

Defects during the production process might include missing and misaligned components as well as poor solder connections.

The hardware framework involves the setup of devices and modules. The software framework is composed of pre-processing and post-processing. In pre-processing, image enhancement is applied to remove noises from captured images and You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detector for components detection. Subsequently, the detected components are compared to the corresponding defined pattern using a template-matching algorithm.

Two-arm self-complementary Archimedean spiral antennas (SCASAs) were introduced as examination targets with pattern distortions from potential process variations, in which bulges and neckings were mathematically generated to imitate uncontrollable ink rheology in printed and flexible electronics, covering the unexplored parts in previous works. The SCASAs in the training group were fabricated by standard printed circuit board procedures, and their pattern integrity in terms of line edge roughness (LER) and coupling frequency were collected through AOI for ML as the feature and label, respectively. The established AI model was based on Gaussian process regression with covariance function of exponential that showed the smallest root-mean-square-error and the largest coefficient of determination through iterative lazy-learning. By feeding the LERs of the SCASAs into the testing group, their corresponding coupling frequencies were estimated by the established AI model with high confidence level. Good linearity between the estimated and measured responses indicated that a reliable AI model and procedure were built, which outperforms existing methods that are unable to project off-line active characteristics of microelectronic components from their in-line pattern integrities. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an investigation into the feasibility of repurposing end-of-life notebook computers as thin client computers. Repurposing is the identification of a new use for a product that can no longer be used in its original form and has the potential to become a hybrid re-use/recycling end-of-life strategy for suitable e-waste when direct reuse is not economically or technically feasible. In this instance, it was targeted to produce thin client computers using motherboards, processors and memory from used laptops while recycling all other components. Notebook computers are of interest for this type of strategy due to having a substantial environmental impact in manufacturing but often not having the option of direct reuse as they are prone to damage and experience a rapid loss of value over time. They also contain multiple critical raw materials with very low recycling rates. The notebook computers were sourced from Civic Amenity sites (CA) and originated from business-to-consumer (B2C) channels. A total of 246 notebook computers were collected and analysed. The paper outlines a methodology developed to identify, test, analyse, and disassemble suitable devices for repurposing. The methodology consists of the following stages with associated pass rates; Visual Inspection \& Power-on Test (32\%) the Initial-stage functionality test comprised of Functionality Test (56\%), Diagnostics (100\%) and Benchmarking (86\%). The Disassembly stage had a pass rate of 100\% and the Post-Disassembly Test comprised of a Validation test (86\%). The Final-stage functionality test had a pass rate of 61\%. The overall results show that 9\% of the notebook computers were suitable for repurposing as thin client computers. It recommends the following design changes to notebooks/laptops that would support repurposing; 1) PCB mounted Fan and Heatsink assembly, 2) Eliminate daughter and I/O boards, 3) A separate Power Button assembly, 4) Reduction in size of the motherboards surface area or physical size. These design changes would allow for a more efficient transition for a change of role. A streamlined lifecycle analysis based on Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) was undertaken to compare the impact of repurposed notebook computers with new thin client computers. The results indicated that there are significant potential savings to be made by extending lifetimes and offsetting the production of new thin client computers under a range of assumptions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging approach that leverages machine learning to develop optimization methods, aiming at reducing the laborious iterations of hand engineering. It automates the design of an optimization method based on its performance on a set of training problems. This data-driven procedure generates methods that can efficiently solve problems similar to those in training. In sharp contrast, the typical and traditional designs of optimization methods are theory-driven, so they obtain performance guarantees over the classes of problems speci\_ed by the theory. The difference makes L2O suitable for repeatedly solving a particular optimization problem over a specific distribution of data, while it typically fails on out-of-distribution problems. The practicality of L2O depends on the type of target optimization, the chosen architecture of the method to learn, and the training procedure. This new paradigm has motivated a community of researchers to explore L2O and report their findings.This article is poised to be the first comprehensive survey and benchmark of L2O for continuous optimization. We set up taxonomies, categorize existing works and research directions, present insights, and identify open challenges. We benchmarked many existing L2O approaches on a few representative optimization problems.

	abstract = {The use of additive technologies in the creation of soldering masks opens up new opportunities in the production of printed circuit boards, in particular, the use of soldering masks for boards with integrated components. The paper considers the results of experimental data on the adhesion of 3D soldering masks (that is, masks created on a 3D printer) obtained during the study of the introduction of 3D printing into electronic manufacturing processes. For the analysis of adhesion, it is possible to use such methods as breaking load, cross-cut test, and the sticky tape method. A number of experiments were conducted to study the adhesion by testing the breaking load. The samples were formed with different ratios of prepreg/solder mask, then the force at which the fracture occurred was measured. The essence of the cross-cut test is to apply at least three parallel cuts and perpendicular to them also at least three parallel cuts with the tip of the cutter. After the scratching, there must be no flaking of the coating between the lines and in the grid of squares, then the results are assessed. Sticky tape tests are performed by applying the tape with the adhesive side to the test sample with a cured coating applied. The results are assessed by visual inspection using an optical device that provides 3x magnification. The results of the breaking load experiments indicate that 3D masks show comparable separation forces with a prepreg. At the same time, the force is stable for all types of surfaces and practically does not depend on the thickness and configuration of the 3D mask. Experiments with applying cross-cuts show consistently good results with a homogeneous base material - there are no coating detachments. The paper concludes that the use of 3D soldering masks on the inner layers of multilayer printed circuit boards with built-in components is possible, but a number of issues must be solved for this, including those related to the software for forming 3D structures of masks. © 2021 The Author.

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of false alarm in PCB defect detection in the automatic optical inspection process, many researchers have proposed their methods, but most of them only classify the single defect in single image, and there are multiple defects and multiple categories in single image. In this paper, a real PCB data set consisting of 1540 images generated by AOI is introduced for the detection and classification task. In addition, we propose an improved PCB defect detector based on feature pyramid networks. The detector combines Faster R-CNN and FPN as the infrastructure, and has been adjusted and improved, mainly including the following three innovations: 1) SE module is inserted into the feature extraction backbone network resnet-101, which improves the expression ability of network. 2) An enhanced bottom-up structure is introduced to enhance the whole feature level by using accurate low-level positioning signals. 3) ROI Align is used instead of RoI Pooling to reduce the impact of dislocation on small object defect detection. The experimental results show that, compared with the mainstream object detection network, the proposed method achieves better accuracy, reaching 96.3\% mAP, and has better performance for defect detection and classification.},

	abstract = {The high memory storage capacity is one of the main characteristics of current electronic devices. In the manufacture of high storage memories, more complex operations are required in the semiconductor encapsulation process, making this production phase more susceptible to failures. The semiconductor encapsulation process is a sensitive operation, given the high cost of equipment and materials, in this sense, a rigorous inspection process is a key task to keep the productive activity viable. This work addresses the automatic fault detection in the silicon wafer soldering procedure, allowing the identification of faults before the epoxy resin molding process. In addition, it provides reasonable information about the soldering step, reducing waste and increasing the inspection volume. We propose a methodology to classify solder balls, in the soldering process of silicon wafers in Ball Grid Array (BGA), contained in substrates of Printed Circuit Board (PCB). This approach consists of two steps: i) Segmentation of solder balls from silicon wafer images; and ii) Classification of solder balls by applying a deep learning technique. The relationship between the visual features and the different welding conditions is learned by the proposed predictive model. The proposed approach was validated by carrying out real and simulated experiments, which obtained high precision results of 98.009\% when the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used. Furthermore, in the worst-case scenario, where Salt and Pepper and Gaussian noises were applied to the images, the proposed approach presented high accuracy of 97.803\% and 96.567\%, respectively. Based on the above and on the analysis of the obtained results in the experiments, this work demonstrated reliability and robustness, optimizing the manufacturing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {When Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used in safety-critical systems, engineers should determine the safety risks associated with failures (i.e., erroneous outputs) observed during testing. For DNNs processing images, engineers visually inspect all failure-inducing images to determine common characteristics among them. Such characteristics correspond to hazard-triggering events (e.g., low illumination) that are essential inputs for safety analysis. Though informative, such activity is expensive and error prone.To support such safety analysis practices, we propose Simulator-based Explanations for DNN failurEs (SEDE), a technique that generates readable descriptions for commonalities in failure-inducing, real-world images and improves the DNN through effective retraining. SEDE leverages the availability of simulators, which are commonly used for cyber-physical systems. It relies on genetic algorithms to drive simulators toward the generation of images that are similar to failure-inducing, real-world images in the test set; it then employs rule learning algorithms to derive expressions that capture commonalities in terms of simulator parameter values. The derived expressions are then used to generate additional images to retrain and improve the DNN.With DNNs performing in-car sensing tasks, SEDE successfully characterized hazard-triggering events leading to a DNN accuracy drop. Also, SEDE enabled retraining leading to significant improvements in DNN accuracy, up to 18 percentage points.},

Such technology advancement has increased workload of operators and time taken to perform inspection. This study is aimed to reduce time consumption and cognitive load of operators, while ensuring consistency of visual inspection during component verification process by utilizing deep learning models to perform object detection based automated optical inspection of images consisting electronic components. Three deep learning algorithms were used in the study, which are Faster R-CNN, YOLO v3 and SSD FPN. Both Faster R-CNN and SSD FPN utilized ResNet-50 backbone, whereas YOLO v3 was built with Darknet-53 backbone. Various input image dimension and image resizing options were explored to determine the best model for object detection. At the end of the study, SSD FPN with input image dimension resized to 640 × 640 by keeping image aspect ratio and with padding is concluded as the best localization and classification model to perform object detection for various types of components present in digital image. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In parallel, testbeds have sought to evaluate emerging concepts such as highly-directional and distributed wireless communications. However, there is a lack of intersection between the two works to characterize the impact of the drone body, antenna placement, swarm topologies, and multi-dimensional connectivity needs that require in-flight experimentation with a surrounding testbed infrastructure. In this work, we design a Multi-Dimensional Drone Communications Infrastructure (MuDDI) to capture complex spatial wireless channel relationships that drone links experience as applications scale from single-drone to swarm-level networks within a shared three-dimensional space. Driven by the challenges of outdoor experimentation, we identify the need for a highly-controlled indoor environment where external factors can be mitigated. To do so, we first build an open-source drone platform to provide programmable control with visibility into the internal flight control system and sensors enabling specialized coordination and accurate repeatable positioning within the isolated environment. We then design a wireless data acquisition system and integrate distributed software defined radios (SDRs) in order to inspect multi-dimensional wireless behavior from the surrounding area. We achieve and demonstrate the value of measurement perspectives from diverse altitudes and spatial locations with the same notion of time. Finally, we demonstrate how multi-dimensional models from experimental measurements can be implemented to simulate multi-drone networks on a practical scale.},

However, most previous studies have focused only on the utilization of defect samples with visible defects and underestimated the value of template samples without surface defects. In fact, template samples can provide sufficient prior information to identify defects and are not difficult to obtain in many manufacturing scenarios. Therefore, an adaptive feature reconstruction network (AFRNet) is proposed in this paper to utilize these two types of samples. Specifically, AFRNet consists of two main components: a Siamese encoder with shared parameters for extracting features from the input sample pair, and a symmetrical feature reconstruction module for adaptively fusing these extracted features. Similar image-level and feature-level fusion schemes, as well as spatial misalignment caused by unaligned sample pairs have been carefully studied. Extensive experiments on a real-world PCB surface-defect dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it can significantly improve the segmentation performance of multiple baselines, such as DANet, PSPNet and DeepLabv3. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

To address these issues, we propose an ensemble methodology that combines lightweight models with custom data augmentation techniques to enhance defect classification accuracy in real-time production environments. Our approach mitigates overfitting in small datasets by generating diverse models through advanced data augmentation and employing feature-specific validation strategies. These models are integrated into an ensemble framework, achieving complementary results that improve classification accuracy while reducing computational overhead. We validate the proposed method using two datasets: the general classification dataset CIFAR-10 and an on-site real-world PCB dataset. With our approach, the average accuracy on CIFAR-10 improved from 97.6\% to 98.2\%, and the accuracy on the PCB dataset increased from 81\% to 89\%. These results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in addressing data scarcity and computational challenges in real-world manufacturing scenarios. By improving quality control and reducing waste, our method optimizes production processes and contributes to sustainability through cost savings and environmental benefits. The proposed methodology is versatile, scalable, and applicable to a range of defect classification tasks beyond PCB manufacturing, making it a robust solution for modern production systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {90\% of retail sales occur in physical stores. In these physical stores 40\% of shoppers leave the store based on the wait time. Autonomous stores can remove customer waiting time by providing a receipt without the need for scanning the items. Prior approaches use computer vision only, combine computer vision with weight sensors, or combine computer vision with sensors and human product recognition. These approaches, in general, suffer from low accuracy, up to hour long delays for receipt generation, or do not scale to store level deployments due to computation requirements and real-world multiple shopper scenarios.We present ISACS, which combines a physical store model (e.g. customers, shelves, and item interactions), multi-human 3D pose estimation, and live inventory monitoring to provide an accurate matching of multiple people to multiple products. ISACS utilizes only shelf weight sensors and does not require visual inventory monitoring which drastically reduces the computational requirements and thus is scalable to a store-level deployment. In addition, ISACS generates an instant receipt by not requiring human intervention during receipt generation. To fully evaluate the ISACS, we deployed and evaluated our approach in an operating convenience store covering 800 square feet with 1653 distinct products, and more than 20,000 items. Over the course of 13 months of operation, ISACS achieved a receipt daily accuracy of up to 96.4\%. Which translates to a 3.5x reduction in error compared to self-checkout stations.},

In mixed-reality (MR) environments, haptic feedback to fingers should be achieved without covering the fingerpad because seamless interactions with both physical and virtual objects are required. However, previous haptic devices cannot provide a wide range of haptic feedback without interfering with physical interactions. Here, we propose a novel self-contained fingerpad-free haptic device named Fingeret, which enables a wide range of feedback and seamless interactions in MR environments. Specifically, we combined newly developed actuators for the sides of fingers, hereafter named finger side actuators (FSAs), with a conventional fingernail actuator (FNA) to obtain a wide range of haptic feedback. FSAs are suitable for relatively low-frequency haptic feedback, whereas FNA is suitable for relatively high-frequency haptic feedback. Our user study showed that the two actuators have complementary roles in covering a wide range of haptic feedback. Finally, we demonstrated an application scenario for designing molecules using an MR tool using Fingeret.},

Our surveys (n=1499 and n=1501) show interest in interactive graphical displays for hidden interfaces — however, covering such displays significantly limits brightness, material possibilities and legibility. To overcome these limitations, we leverage parallel rendering to enable ultrabright graphics that can pass through everyday materials. We unlock expressive hidden interfaces using rectilinear graphics on low-cost, mass-produced passive-matrix OLED displays. A technical evaluation across materials, shapes and display techniques, suggests 3.6–40X brightness increase compared to more complex active-matrix OLEDs. We present interactive prototypes that blend into wood, textile, plastic and mirrored surfaces. Survey feedback (n=1572) on our prototypes suggests that smart mirrors are particularly desirable. A lab evaluation (n=11) reinforced these findings and allowed us to also characterize performance from hands-on interaction with different content, materials and under varying lighting conditions.},

	abstract = {Locating underwater robots is fundamental for enabling important underwater applications. The current mainstream method requires a physical infrastructure with relays on the water surface, which is largely ad-hoc, introduces a significant logistical overhead, and entails limited scalability. Our work, Sunflower, presents the first demonstration of wireless, 3D localization across the air-water interface - eliminating the need for additional infrastructure on the water surface. Specifically, we propose a laser-based sensing system to enable aerial drones to directly locate underwater robots. The Sunflower system consists of a queen and a worker component on a drone and each tracked underwater robot, respectively. To achieve robust sensing, key system elements include (1) a pinhole-based sensing mechanism to address the sensing skew at air-water boundary and determine the incident angle on the worker, (2) a novel optical-fiber sensing ring to sense weak retroreflected light, (3) a laser-optimized backscatter communication design that exploits laser polarization to maximize retroreflected energy, and (4) the necessary models and algorithms for underwater sensing. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our Sunflower system achieves average localization error of 9.7 cm with ranges up to 3.8 m and is robust against ambient light interference and wave conditions.},

The growing number of Electronic Control Units in a vehicle, together with their increasing complexity, prompts the need for automated tools to test their security. To this end, we present EffCAN, a tool for ECU firmware fuzzing via Controller Area Network. EffCAN operates on the Control Flow Graph, which we extract from the firmware. The Control Flow Graph is a platform independent representation, which allows us to abstract from the often obscure underlying architecture. The Control Flow Graph is annotated with information about static data comparisons that affect the control flow of the firmware. This information is used to create initial seeds for the fuzzer. It is also used to adapt the input messages in order to cover hard to reach execution paths. We have evaluated EffCAN on three Electronic Control Units, from different manufacturers. The fuzzer was able to crash two of the units. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that uses static analysis to guide the fuzzing of automotive Electronic Control Units.},

A multimedia processing pipeline fetches mountain images from multiple sources and extracts virtual snow indexes correlated to the amount of water accumulated in the snow pack. Such indexes are used to predict water availability and design the operating policy of Lake Como, Italy. The performance of this informed policy is contrasted, via simulation, with the current operation, which depends only on lake water level and day of the year, and with a policy that exploits official Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) estimated from ground stations data and satellite imagery. Virtual snow indexes allow improving the system performance by 11.6\% w.r.t. the baseline operation, and yield further improvement when coupled with official SWE information, showing that the two data sources are complementary. The proposed approach exemplifies the opportunities and challenges of applying multimedia content analysis methods to complex environmental problems.},

Due to the proximity of printers to places with potentially high-stakes information, the possible misuse of these devices is concerning. We present a previously unexplored covert channel that effectively uses the sound generated by printers with inkjet technology to exfiltrate arbitrary sensitive data (unrelated to the apparent content of the document being printed) from an air-gapped network. We also discuss a series of defense techniques that can make these devices invulnerable to covert manipulation.The proposed covert channel works by malware installed on a computer with access to a printer, injecting certain imperceptible patterns into all documents that applications on the computer send to the printer. These patterns can control the printing process without visibly altering the original content of a document, and generate acoustic signals that a nearby acoustic recording device, such as a smartphone, can capture and decode. To prove and analyze the capabilities of this new covert channel, we carried out tests considering different types of document layouts and distances between the printer and recording device. We achieved a bit error ratio less than 5\% and an average bit rate of approximately 0.5 bps across all tested printers at distances up to 4 m, which is sufficient to extract tiny bits of information.},

	abstract = {Many modern applications require low-latency processing of large data sets, often by using approximate algorithms that trade accuracy of the results for faster execution or reduced memory consumption. Although the algorithms provide probabilistic accuracy and performance guarantees, a software developer who implements these algorithms has little support from existing tools. Standard profilers do not consider accuracy of the computation and do not check whether the outputs of these programs satisfy their accuracy specifications.We present AxProf, an algorithmic profiling framework for analyzing randomized approximate programs. The developer provides the accuracy specification as a formula in a mathematical notation, using probability or expected value predicates. AxProf automatically generates statistical reasoning code. It first constructs the empirical models of accuracy, time, and memory consumption. It then selects and runs appropriate statistical tests that can, with high confidence, determine if the implementation satisfies the specification.We used AxProf to profile 15 approximate applications from three domains - data analytics, numerical linear algebra, and approximate computing. AxProf was effective in finding bugs and identifying various performance optimizations. In particular, we discovered five previously unknown bugs in the implementations of the algorithms and created fixes, guided by AxProf.},

Through the use of deep neural networks, facial recognition has achieved excellent performance. However, this is only possibly when trained with hundreds of images of each user in different viewing and lighting conditions. Clearly, this level of effort in enrolment and labelling is impossible for wide-spread deployment and adoption. Inspired by the fact that most people carry smart wireless devices with them, e.g. smartphones, we propose to use this wireless identifier as a supervisory label. This allows us to curate a dataset of facial images that are unique to a certain domain e.g. a set of people in a particular office. This custom corpus can then be used to finetune existing pre-trained models e.g. FaceNet. However, due to the vagaries of wireless propagation in buildings, the supervisory labels are noisy and weak. We propose a novel technique, AutoTune, which learns and refines the association between a face and wireless identifier over time, by increasing the inter-cluster separation and minimizing the intra-cluster distance. Through extensive experiments with multiple users on two sites, we demonstrate the ability of AutoTune to design an environment-specific, continually evolving facial recognition system with entirely no user effort.},

Informally, it exploits techniques from the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) literature in order to exponentially reduce the probability of a successful Trojan attack. As a result, its concrete relevance depends on ( i ) the possibility to reach good performances with affordable hardware, and ( ii ) the actual number of trusted gates the solution requires. In this paper, we assess the practicality of the CCS 2016 Trojan-resilient compiler based on a block cipher case study, and optimize its performances in different directions. From the algorithmic viewpoint, we use a recent MPC protocol by Araki et al. (CCS 2016) in order to increase the throughput of our implementations, and we investigate various block ciphers and S-box representations to reduce their communication complexity. From a design viewpoint, we develop an architecture that balances the computation and communication cost of our Trojan-resilient circuits. From an implementation viewpoint, we describe a prototype hardware combining several commercial FPGAs on a dedicated printed circuit board. Thanks to these advances, we exhibit realistic performances for a Trojan-resilient circuit purposed for high-security applications, and confirm that the amount of trusted gates required by the CCS 2016 compiler is well minimized.},

	abstract = {Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Cigarette smoke includes thousands of chemicals that are harmful and cause tobacco-related diseases. To date, the causality between human exposure to specific compounds and the harmful effects is unknown. A first step in closing the gap in knowledge has been measuring smoking topography, or how the smoker smokes the cigarette (puffs, puff volume, and duration). However, current gold-standard approaches to smoking topography involve expensive, bulky, and obtrusive sensor devices, creating unnatural smoking behavior and preventing their potential for real-time interventions in the wild. Although motion-based wearable sensors and their corresponding machine-learned models have shown promise in unobtrusively tracking smoking gestures, they are notorious for confounding smoking with other similar hand-to-mouth gestures such as eating and drinking. In this paper, we present SmokeMon, a chest-worn thermal-sensing wearable system that can capture spatial, temporal, and thermal information around the wearer and cigarette all day to unobtrusively and passively detect smoking events. We also developed a deep learning–based framework to extract puffs and smoking topography. We evaluate SmokeMon in both controlled and free-living experiments with a total of 19 participants, more than 110 hours of data, and 115 smoking sessions achieving an F1-score of 0.9 for puff detection in the laboratory and 0.8 in the wild. By providing SmokeMon as an open platform, we provide measurement of smoking topography in free-living settings to enable testing of smoking topography in the real world, with potential to facilitate timely smoking cessation interventions.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) has been demonstrated to improve efficiency by up to thrice the level of traditional methods. Specifically, the adoption of visual AR is performed widely using handheld and head-mount technologies. Despite spatial augmented reality (SAR) addressing several shortcomings of wearable AR, its potential is yet to be fully explored. To date, it enhances the cooperation of users with its wide field of view and supports hands-free mobile operation, yet it has remained a challenge to provide references without relying on restrictive static empty surfaces of the same object or nearby objects for projection. Towards this end, we propose a novel approach that contextualizes projected references in real-time and on demand, onto and through the surface across a wireless network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply the method to the safe inspection of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) wirelessly networked to a remote automatic optical inspection (AOI) system. A defect detected and localized by the AOI system is wirelessly remitted to the proposed remote inspection system for prompt guidance to the inspector by augmenting a rectangular bracket and a reference image. The rectangular bracket transmitted through the switchable glass aids defect localization over the PCBA, whereas the image is projected over the opaque cells of the switchable glass to provide reference to a user. The developed system is evaluated in a user study for its robustness, precision and performance. Results indicate that the resulting contextualization from variability in occlusion levels not only positively affect inspection performance but also supersedes the state of the art in user preference. Furthermore, it supports a variety of complex visualization needs including varied sizes, contrast, online or offline tracking, with a simple robust integration requiring no additional calibration for registration. © 2020 by the authors.

Current inside-out systems often rely on vision-based methods utilizing handheld controllers or incorporating densely distributed body-worn IMU sensors. The former limits hands-free and occlusion-robust interactions, while the latter is plagued by inadequate accuracy and jittering. We introduce a novel body tracking system, MI-Poser, which employs AR glasses and two wrist-worn electromagnetic field (EMF) sensors to achieve high-fidelity upper-body pose estimation while mitigating metal interference. Our lightweight system demonstrates a minimal error (6.6 cm mean joint position error) with real-world data collected from 10 participants. It remains robust against various upper-body movements and operates efficiently at 60 Hz. Furthermore, by incorporating an IMU sensor co-located with the EMF sensor, MI-Poser presents solutions to counteract the effects of metal interference, which inherently disrupts the EMF signal during tracking. Our evaluation effectively showcases the successful detection and correction of interference using our EMF-IMU fusion approach across environments with diverse metal profiles. Ultimately, MI-Poser offers a practical pose tracking system, particularly suited for body-centric AR applications.},

This novel approach integrates cutting-edge components such as Swin Transformers, Dynamic Snake Convolution (DySnakeConv), and Biformer within the YOLOv8 architecture, aiming to address and overcome the limitations associated with traditional PCB inspection methods. The YOLOv8-TDD adaptation incorporates Swin Transformers to leverage hierarchical feature processing with shifted windows, enhancing the model’s efficiency and capability in capturing complex image details. Dynamic Snake Convolution is implemented to dynamically adapt filter responses based on the input feature maps, offering tailored feature extraction that is highly responsive to the varied textures and defects in PCBs. The Biformer, with bidirectional processing capability, enriches the model’s contextual understanding, providing a comprehensive analysis of the PCB images to pinpoint defects more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-TDD model, achieves a precision of 97.9\%, a mean Average Precision (mAP0.5) of 95.71\%.

Existing defect inspection technologies can identify defects but fail to classify all PCB defect types. This research thus proposes an algorithmic scheme that can detect and categorize all 14-known PCB defect types. In the proposed algorithmic scheme, fuzzy cmeans clustering is used for image segmentation via image subtraction prior to defect detection. Arithmetic and logic operations, the circle hough transform (CHT),morphological reconstruction (MR), and connected component labeling (CCL) are used in defect classification. The algorithmic scheme achieves 100\% defect detection and 99.05\% defect classification accuracies. The novelty of this research lies in the concurrent use of CHT, MR, and CCL algorithms to accurately detect and classify all 14-known PCB defect types and determine the defect characteristics such as the location, area, and nature of defects. This information is helpful in electronic parts manufacturing for finding the root causes of PCB defects and appropriately adjusting the manufacturing process. Moreover, the algorithmic scheme can be integrated into machine vision to streamline the manufacturing process, improve the PCB quality, and lower the production cost. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a key technology anchored towards realizing Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing aims. In manufacturing inspection, AR has previously been employed to support operators in assessing thickness of manufactured parts, ship building, aircraft subassemblies and printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) with or without external markers in standalone head-mounted (HMD) or handheld systems. These AR systems often use optical see-through (OST) or video see-through (VST) technologies. Currently, cyber physical integration of processes in an industrial system synergizes production through increased efficiency and improved quality while facilitating customization. An operator manually double-checking/inspecting a product that has previously been automatically inspected can better rely on this existing defect location information once it is contextually and spatially overlaid within their field of view to intuitively and efficiently execute the task. Additional interactive information provided can quickly reorient a user, provide necessary contextual reference, and monitor progress of the task while alerting them of their safety. In this study, adopting an automatic optical inspection (AOI) wirelessly aided HMD-OST AR-based manual inspection system requiring no external markers for contextual registration is a promising direction towards smart and safe PCBA manufacturing in line with Industry 4.0. Animated rectangular bracket of high color contrast is employed to localize the spawned AOI defect point, an arrow overlaid with distance text provides user guidance, a contextual resizable image facilitates user double-checking and a progress bar tracks the inspection progress while monitoring tracking state. We evaluate the developed system's robustness, effectiveness of display technology used, suitability of contextual against static display modes, and display technology influence on various inspection attributes in a user study. Results demonstrate the system to be robust, OST-HMD outperforms handheld VST devices, contextual display mode to be significantly preferred to static mode, and display technology employed has no significant influence on the inspection attributes. Finally, registration precision results demonstrate usability of the system while superposition of distance to orientation information raises the inspection rate of PCBAs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We challenge the conventional assumption that motion and actuation are beyond the capabilities of battery-free devices and demonstrate completely untethered autonomous operation in realistic indoor and outdoor lighting as well as RF power delivery scenarios. We show first that through miniaturizing a robot to gram scale, we can significantly reduce the energy required to move it. Second, we develop methods to produce intermittent motion by discharging a small capacitor (47–150 μF) to move a motor in discrete steps, enabling motion from as little as 50 μW of power or less. We further develop software defined techniques for maximizing power harvesting. MilliMobile operates in the optimal part of the charging curve by varying the charging time to achieve maximum speeds of up to 5.5 mm/s.The MilliMobile prototype has a 10x10 mm chassis and weighs less than 1.1 g. Our robot can carry payloads 3 times its own weight, and only experiences a 25\% reduction in speed when carrying a 1 g payload. We demonstrate operation on 10 different surfaces ranging from wood and concrete to compact soil. We further show the ability to cold-start and move in light conditions as low as 20 W/m2 and -10 dBm of RF power. In addition to operating on harvested power, our robot demonstrates sensor and control autonomy by seeking light using onboard photodiodes, and can transmit sensor data wirelessly to a base station over 200 m away.},

	abstract = {The process of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) involves several machines, such as a stencil printer, placement machine and reflow oven, to solder and assemble electronic components onto printed circuit boards (PCBs). In the production flow, some failure prevention mechanisms are deployed to ensure the designated quality of PCBA, including solder paste inspection (SPI), automated optical inspection (AOI) and in-circuit testing (ICT). However, such methods to locate the failures are reactive in nature, which may create waste and require additional effort to be spent re-manufacturing and inspecting the PCBs. Worse still, the process performance of the assembly process cannot be guaranteed at a high level. Therefore, there is a need to improve the performance of the PCBA process. To address the aforementioned challenges in the PCBA process, an intelligent assembly process improvement system (IAPIS) is proposed, which integrates the k-means clustering method and multi-response Taguchi method to formulate a pro-active approach to investigate and manage the process performance. The critical process parameters are first identified by means of k-means clustering and the selected parameters are then used to formulate a set of experimental studies by using the multi-response Taguchi method to optimize the performance of the assembly process. To validate the proposed system, a case study of an electronics manufacturer in the solder paste printing process was conducted. The contributions of this study are two-fold: (i) pressure, blade angle and speed are identified as the critical factors in the solder paste printing process; and (ii) a significant improvement in the yield performance of PCBA can be achieved as a component in the smart manufacturing. © The Author(s) 2020.},

A database of 6000 sample images of printed circuit board (PCB) connectors collected from factories was compiled. A novel confidence synthesis mechanism was proposed to prescreen images using deep learning features. Spatially connected texture features were then used to reclassify images with low reliabilities.

Although the root cause of the problem still remains unknown, recent advancements in brain imaging technology reveal there exists differences between neural activities of Typically Developing Children (TDC) and ADHD subjects. Inspired by this, we propose a novel First-Take-All (FTA) hashing framework to investigate the problem of fast ADHD subjects detection through the fMRI time-series of neuron activities. By hashing time courses from regions of interests (ROIs) in the brain into fixed-size hash codes, FTA can compactly encode the temporal order differences between the neural activity patterns that are key to distinguish TDC and ADHD subjects. Such patterns can be directly learned via minimizing the training loss incurred by the generated FTA codes. By conducting similarity search on the resultant FTA codes, data-driven ADHD detection can be achieved in an efficient fashion. The experiments' results on real-world ADHD detection benchmarks demonstrate the FTA can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines using only neural activity time series without any phenotypic information.},

	abstract = {As technology evolves, more components are integrated into printed circuit boards (PCBs) and the PCB layout increases. Because small defects on signal trace can cause significant damage to the system, PCB surface inspection is one of the most important quality control processes. Owing to the limitations of manual inspection, significant efforts have been made to automate the inspection by utilizing high resolution CCD or CMOS sensors. Despite the advanced sensor technology, setting the pass/fail criteria based on small failure samples has always been challenging in traditional machine vision approaches. To overcome these problems, we propose an advanced PCB inspection system based on a skip-connected convolutional autoencoder. The deep autoencoder model was trained to decode the original non-defect images from the defect images. The decoded images were then compared with the input image to identify the defect location. To overcome the small and imbalanced dataset in the early manufacturing stage, we applied appropriate image augmentation to improve the model training performance. The experimental results reveal that a simple unsupervised autoencoder model delivers promising performance, with a detection rate of up to 98\% and a false pass rate below 1.7\% for the test data, containing 3900 defect and non-defect images. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms alternate between (approximate) policy evaluation and (approximate) greedification. Many different approaches have been explored for approximate policy evaluation, but less is understood about approximate greedification and what choices guarantee policy improvement. In this work, we investigate approximate greedi\_cation when reducing the KL divergence between the parameterized policy and the Boltzmann distribution over action values. In particular, we investigate the difference between the forward and reverse KL divergences, with varying degrees of entropy regularization; these are chosen because they underlie many existing policy optimization approaches, as we highlight in this work. We show that the reverse KL has stronger policy improvement guarantees, and that reducing the forward KL can result in a worse policy. We also demonstrate, however, that a large enough reduction of the forward KL can induce improvement under additional assumptions. Empirically, we show on simple continuous-action environments that the forward KL can induce more exploration, but at the cost of a more suboptimal policy. No significant differences were observed in the discrete-action setting or on a suite of benchmark problems. This work provides novel theoretical and empirical insights about the forward KL and reverse KL for greedification, and clear next steps for understanding and improving our policy optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Search Engines such as Google, Baidu, and Bing have revolutionized the way we interact with the cyber world with a number of applications in recommendations, learning, advertisements, healthcare, entertainment, etc. In this paper, we design search engines for sign languages such as American Sign Language (ASL). Sign languages use hand and body motion for communication with rich grammar, complexity, and vocabulary that is comparable to spoken languages. This is the primary language for the Deaf community with a global population of ≈ 500 million. However, search engines that support sign language queries in native form do not exist currently. While translating a sign language to a spoken language and using existing search engines might be one possibility, this can miss critical information because existing translation systems are either limited in vocabulary or constrained to a specific domain. In contrast, this paper presents a holistic approach where ASL queries in native form as well as ASL videos and textual information available online are converted into a common representation space. Such a joint representation space provides a common framework for precisely representing different sources of information and accurately matching a query with relevant information that is available online. Our system uses low-intrusive wearable sensors for capturing the sign query. To minimize the training overhead, we obtain synthetic training data from a large corpus of online ASL videos across diverse topics. Evaluated over a set of Deaf users with native ASL fluency, the accuracy is comparable with state-of-the-art recommendation systems for Amazon, Netflix, Yelp, etc., suggesting the usability of the system in the real world. For example, the re-call@10 of our system is 64.3\%, i.e., among the top ten search results, six of them are relevant to the search query. Moreover, the system is robust to variations in signing patterns, dialects, sensor positions, etc.},

The concept of "smart manufacturing" is closely related to the concept of cyber-physical systems, which integrates the main elements of digitalization and intellectualization. This concept provides for the continuous improvement of intellectual "cybernetic" resources for the effective management of the "physical" environment considered in this problem area. Improvement of technologies, ensuring high rates of reproducibility and suitability of equipment creates conditions for defect-free production. However, there remain the problems of recognizing patterns represented not by an obvious marriage, but by some not fully defined inconsistency on a set of requirements. The need to disclose uncertainties of this kind is typical for surface mounting technologies for printed circuit boards. The introduction of more and more advanced automatic optical inspections, containing the possibility of introducing intelligent (cybernetic) means, creates conditions for improving the quality of printed circuit boards as a "physical" environment. It is also important to minimize the "human factor", the presence of which is still used when making decisions on the results of control.

	abstract = {Autonomous, continuous and long-term monitoring systems are required to prognosticate failures in civil infrastructures due to material fatigue or extreme events like earthquakes. While current battery-powered wireless sensors can evaluate the condition of the structure at a given instant of time, they require frequent replacement of batteries due to the need for continuous or frequent sampling. On the other hand, self-powered sensors can continuously monitor the structural condition without the need for any maintenance; however, the scarcity of harvested power limits the range at which the sensors could be wirelessly interrogated. In this paper, we propose a quasi-self-powered sensor that combines the benefits of self-powered sensing and with the benefits of battery-powered wireless transmission. By optimizing both of the functionalities, a complete sensor system can be designed that can continuously operate between the structure's maintenance life-cycles and can be wirelessly interrogated at distances that obviates the need for taking the structure out-of-service. As a case study, in this paper we present the design considerations involved in prototyping quasi-self-powered sensors for deployment on the Mackinac Bridge in northern Michigan, with a target operational life span greater than 20 years.},

	abstract = {Printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing processes are becoming increasingly complex, where even minor defects can impair product performance and yield rates. Precisely identifying PCB defects is critical but remains challenging. Traditional PCB defect detection methods, such as visual inspection and automated technologies, have limitations. While defects can be readily identified based on symmetry, the operational aspect proves to be quite challenging. Deep learning has shown promise in defect detection; however, current deep learning models for PCB defect detection still face issues like large model size, slow detection speed, and suboptimal accuracy. This paper proposes a lightweight YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8)-based model called LW-YOLO (Lightweight You Only Look Once) to address these limitations. Specifically, LW-YOLO incorporates a bidirectional feature pyramid network for multiscale feature fusion, a Partial Convolution module to reduce redundant calculations, and a Minimum Point Distance Intersection over Union loss function to simplify optimization and improve accuracy. Based on the experimental data, LW-YOLO achieved an mAP0.5 of 96.4\%, which is 2.2 percentage points higher than YOLOv8; the precision reached 97.1\%, surpassing YOLOv8 by 1.7 percentage points; and at the same time, LW-YOLO achieved an FPS of 141.5. The proposed strategies effectively enhance efficiency and accuracy for deep-learning-based PCB defect detection. © 2024 by the authors.},

Extensive studies have analyzed the propagation of wireless signals and proposed theoretical models to simulate wireless signal propagation. Unfortunately, models of signal propagation are often not accurate in reality. Real-world signal measurements are required for validation.Existing methods for collecting wireless measurements either involve researchers walking to each location of interest and manually collecting measurements, or place sensors at each measurement location. As such, they require large amounts of time and effort and can be costly. We propose DroneSense, a system for measuring wireless signals in the 3D space using autonomous drones.

	abstract = {Testing Machine Learning (ML) projects is challenging due to inherent non-determinism of various ML algorithms and the lack of reliable ways to compute reference results. Developers typically rely on their intuition when writing tests to check whether ML algorithms produce accurate results. However, this approach leads to conservative choices in selecting assertion bounds for comparing actual and expected results in test assertions. Because developers want to avoid false positive failures in tests, they often set the bounds to be too loose, potentially leading to missing critical bugs.We present FASER - the first systematic approach for balancing the trade-off between the fault-detection effectiveness and flakiness of non-deterministic tests by computing optimal assertion bounds. FASER frames this trade-off as an optimization problem between these competing objectives by varying the assertion bound. FASER leverages 1) statistical methods to estimate the flakiness rate, and 2) mutation testing to estimate the fault-detection effectiveness. We evaluate FASER on 87 non-deterministic tests collected from 22 popular ML projects. FASER finds that 23 out of 87 studied tests have conservative bounds and proposes tighter assertion bounds that maximizes the fault-detection effectiveness of the tests while limiting flakiness. We have sent 19 pull requests to developers, each fixing one test, out of which 14 pull requests have already been accepted.},

	abstract = {3D printed displays promise to create unique visual interfaces for physical objects. However, current methods for creating 3D printed displays either require specialized post-fabrication processes (e.g., electroluminescence spray and silicon casting) or function as passive elements that simply react to environmental factors (e.g., body and air temperature). These passive displays offer limited control over when, where, and how the colors change. In this paper, we introduce ThermoPixels, a method for designing and 3D printing actively controlled and visually rich thermochromic displays that can be embedded in arbitrary geometries. We investigate the color-changing and thermal properties of thermochromic and conductive filaments. Based on these insights, we designed ThermoPixels and an accompanying software tool that allows embedding ThermoPixels in arbitrary 3D geometries, creating displays of various shapes and sizes (flat, curved, or matrix displays) or displays that embed textures, multiple colors, or that are flexible.},

	abstract = {Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are primarily used to connect electronic components to each other. It is one of the most important stages in the manufacturing of electronic products. A small defect in the PCB can make the final product inoperable. Therefore, careful and meticulous defect detection steps are necessary and indispensable in the PCB manufacturing process. The detection methods can generally be divided into manual inspection and automatic optical inspection (AOI). The main disadvantage of manual detection is that the detection speed is too slow, resulting in a waste of human resources and costs. Thus, in order to speed up the production speed, AOI techniques have been adopted by many PCB manufacturers. Most current AOI mechanisms use traditional optical algorithms. These algorithms can easily lead to misjudgments due to different light and shadow changes caused by slight differences in PCB placement or solder amount so that qualified PCBs are judged as defective products, which is also the main reason for the high misjudgment rate of AOI detection. In order to effectively solve the problem of AOI misjudgment, manual re-judgment is currently the reinspection method adopted by most PCB manufacturers for defective products judged by AOI. Undoubtedly, the need for inspectors is another kind of labor cost. To reduce the labor cost. of manual re-judgement, an accurate and efficient PCB defect reinspection mechanism based on deep learning algorithm is proposed. This mechanism mainly establishes two detection models, which can classify the defects of the product. When both models have basic recognition capabilities, the two models are then combined into a main model to improve the accuracy of defect detection. In the study, the data provided by Lite-On Technology Co., Ltd. were implemented. To achieve the practical application value in the industry, this research not only considers the problem of detection accuracy, but also considers the problem of detection execution speed. Therefore, fewer parameters are used in the construction of the model. The research results show that the accuracy rate of defect detection is about 95\%, and the recall rate is 94\%. Compared with other detection modules, the execution speed is greatly improved. The detection time of each image is only 0.027 s, which fully meets the purpose of industrial practical application. © 2023 by the authors.},

Deep learning based surface defect detection algorithm plays a crucial role in improving industrial production efficiency. A large number of existing CNN models aim at building deeper and larger structures, thus deep network models are difficult to be applied in the industrial field because of the requirement of speed in industry. This paper proposes a lightweight end-to-end surface defect detection network (LSDDN) to overcome this problem.

Especially, cracks or scratches appearing on the PCB surface pose a significant hurdle, due to their minuscule size, making them the most challenging to address. In this work, we present a real-time automated algorithm for defects inspection of printed circuit boards (PCBs) in different lighting conditions. First, the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithm extracts features from the input images, then the Brute-force matching method matches these features with the ORB features template. Next, the input images are calibrated to match the size and orientation of the template data by the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm. Finally, the defective areas on the PCB surface are segmented by using the U-NET (i.e., a type of convolutional neural network (CNN)) model. The proposed algorithm is tested in three different lighting conditions: low light, normal light, and high light conditions. Experimental studies are conducted on a representative PCB to evaluate the defect detection capacity of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results show that the proposed system works well in the three different lighting conditions with an accuracy of up to 97\%, the detection speed is 12 frames per second (FPS). © 2025},

We present our design of a dry, dual-electrodes flexible PCB assembly that realizes accurate sensing in the face of practical motion artifacts. Using it, we present WalkingWizard, our prototype dry-electrode EEG baseball cap that can be used under motion in everyday scenarios. We first evaluated its hardware performance by comparing its electrode-scalp impedance and ability to capture alpha rhythm against both wet EEG and commercially available dry EEG headsets. We then tested WalkingWizard using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) experiments, achieving high classification accuracy of 87\% for walking speeds up to 5.0 km/h, beating state-of-the-art. Expanding on WalkingWizard, we integrated all necessary electronic components into a flexible PCB assembly—realizing WalkingWizard Integrated, in a truly wearable form-factor. Utilizing WalkingWizard Integrated, we demonstrated several applications as proof-of-concept: classification of SSVEP in VR environment while walking, real-time acquisition of emotional state of users while moving around the neighbourhood, and understanding the effect of guided meditation for relaxation.},

A small change in orientation of the components might affect the functionality of PCB to an unpredictable extent. We have focused on Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) system for PCB inspection problem in the context of smart manufacturing. The user interface is empowered with bi-directional task—(I) Industrial worker can inspect whether ICs exist or not by comparing with corresponding Gerber file (II) Automatic Inspection of PCB shall be performed in the absence of Gerber file. This is a preliminary step in the direction of automated real-time analysis of PCBs. The work presented in this paper deals with the image acquisition phase of inspection too, which is relatively less investigated when compared to image processing phase. Present automatic inspection is achieved with the histogram of hue values defined in the Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color space. Color distribution-based segmentation is carried out by taking the background color as the dominant value in the histogram. Then in the next step, features extracted from the resultant parts are compared with template ICs to obtain robust results and confirmed ICs are annotated in the live image. We have evaluated the efficiency of the algorithm in four different lighting conditions—outdoor light, LED, CFL, and incandescent lights and observed that 12 W LED works best with 2500 lx illumination. Then with the 12 W LED, we have analyzed accuracy with different camera resolution. We have observed that algorithm works best in the resolution of 1920 × 1080 which is both time consuming and cost-effective. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In this work, we present a novel approach for anomaly detection of PCBs where a U-Net architecture performs binary anomalous region segmentation and DBSCAN algorithm detects and localizes individual defects. At training time, reference images are needed to create annotations of anomalous regions, whereas at test time references images are not needed anymore. The proposed approach is validated on DeepPCB dataset and our internal chip defect dataset. We have achieved 0.80 and 0.75 mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) scores on DeepPCB and chip defect datasets, respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, for optimized and reduced models with computational costs lower than one giga FLOP, mIoU scores of 0.65 and above are achieved justifying the suitability of the proposed approach for embedded and potentially real-time applications.

This is a serious issue that has unfortunately become somewhat normalized due to how deeply embedded it is in the day-to-day lives of people, especially in developing countries. For any society to make significant progress, it is imperative to utilize our technical skills or otherwise to ensure personal safety before anything else. This includes reducing the time of response to an accident to the minimum, among other things. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) based accident detection and response system is an attempt towards minimizing the rates of casualty and injuries occurring to both passengers and vehicles due to road accidents. The system is fully automated to be able to send emergency notifications to nearby hospital or fire station and an emergency contact in case of an accident. This is done via a combination of a vehicle device that has to be installed in the vehicle of the consumer and a remote server system that responds to the device accordingly. The motive is to provide the location of the vehicle and measure the severity of the accident so that help can be provided as fast as possible. From the data values collected from the sensors in the vehicle device prototype, we have tested the notification process successfully and also been able to assess the level of accident severity. We believe this system will reduce the response time of emergency responders and in the process improve both the traffic and health system of a society.},

However, the existing deep learning methods require thousands of images of defects to be used for training the algorithms. It limits the usability of these approaches in manufacturing, due to lack of images of defects before the actual manufacturing starts. In contrast, we propose to train a defect detection unsupervised deep learning model, using a much smaller number of images with-out defects. We propose an unsupervised deep learning model, based on transfer learning, that ex-tracts typical semantic patterns from defect‐free samples (one‐class training). The model is built upon a pre‐trained VGG16 model. It is further trained on custom datasets with different sizes of possible defects (printed circuit boards and soldered joints) using only small number of normal samples. We have found that the defect detection can be performed very well on a smooth back-ground; however, in cases where the defect manifests as a change of texture, the detection can be less accurate. The proposed study uses deep learning self‐supervised approach to identify if the sample under analysis contains any deviations (with types not defined in advance) from normal design. The method would improve the robustness of the AOI process to detect defects. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Because of the transparency of the Android platform and the on-device models inside, on-device models on Android smartphones have been proven to be extremely vulnerable. However, due to the challenge in accessing and analyzing iOS app files, despite iOS being a mobile platform as popular as Android, there are no relevant works on on-device models in iOS apps. Since the functionalities of the same app on Android and iOS platforms are similar, the same vulnerabilities may exist on both platforms. In this article, we present the first empirical study about on-device models in iOS apps, including their adoption of deep learning frameworks, structure, functionality, and potential security issues. We study why current developers use different on-device models for one app between iOS and Android. We propose a more general attack against white-box models that does not rely on pre-trained models and a new adversarial attack approach based on our findings to target iOS’s gray-box on-device models. Our results show the effectiveness of our approaches. Finally, we successfully exploit the vulnerabilities of on-device models to attack real-world iOS apps.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates sound and music interactions arising from the use of electromyography (EMG) to instrumentalise signals from muscle exertion of the human body. We situate EMG within a family of embodied interaction modalities, where it occupies a middle ground, considered as a “signal from the inside” compared with external observations of the body (e.g., motion capture), but also seen as more volitional than neurological states recorded by brain electroencephalogram (EEG). To understand the messiness of gestural interaction afforded by EMG, we revisit the phenomenological turn in HCI, reading Paul Dourish’s work on the transparency of “ready-to-hand” technologies against the grain of recent posthumanist theories, which offer a performative interpretation of musical entanglements between bodies, signals, and representations. We take music performance as a use case, reporting on the opportunities and constraints posed by EMG in workshop-based studies of vocal, instrumental, and electronic practices. We observe that across our diverse range of musical subjects, they consistently challenged notions of EMG as a transparent tool that directly registered the state of the body, reporting instead that it took on “present-at-hand” qualities, defamiliarising the performer’s own sense of themselves and reconfiguring their embodied practice.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the highest quality standards at competitive prices is one of the greatest challenges in the manufacture of electronic products. The identification of flaws has the uppermost priority in the field of automotive electronics, particularly as a failure within this field can result in damages and fatalities. During assembling and soldering of printed circuit boards (PCBs) the circuit carriers can be subject to errors. Hence, automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems are used for real-time detection of visible flaws and defects in production. This article introduces an application strategy for combining a deep learning concept with an optical inspection system based on image processing. Above all, the target is to reduce the risk of error slip through a second inspection. The concept is to have the inspection results additionally evaluated by a convolutional neural network. For this purpose, different training datasets for the deep learning procedures are examined and their effects on the classification accuracy for defect identification are assessed. Furthermore, a suitable compilation of image datasets is elaborated, which ensures the best possible error identification on solder joints of electrical assemblies. With the help of the results, convolutional neural networks can achieve a good recognition performance, so that these can support the automatic optical inspection in a profitable manner. Further research aims at integrating the concept in a fully automated way into the production process in order to decide on the product quality autonomously without human interference. © 2020 Author(s).},

Healthcare personnel is at risk of exposure to the virus every day by serving patients when carrying out tests and monitoring them. Despite the use of personal protective equipment, healthcare personnel is at risk of acquiring the virus. There have been doctors who have been exposed to the virus, became ill, and, in some cases, lost their lives. The goal of developing an electronic system is to assist healthcare workers by using a robot that will complete basic tasks such as taking patient's temperatures. For the design of the robot, a quantitative approach, experimental design, and a "V" methodology were used. As a main result, the approximate robot cost is \$728.

In an initial single-session study (N=25), we achieved mean Equal Error Rates (EERs) of 5.68\% and 7.95\% with microphones on the brow and left mastoid process. Combining the two signals substantially improves performance (to 2.35\% EER). A subsequent multi-session study (N=30) demonstrates EERs are maintained over three recalls and, additionally, shows robustness to donning variations and background noise (achieving 2.72\% EER). In a follow-up usability study over one week, participants report high levels of usability (as expressed by SUS scores) and that only modest workload is required to authenticate. Finally, a security analysis demonstrates the system’s robustness to spoofing and imitation attacks.},

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as an effective approach to understand speech, images, and similar high-dimensional data types. Algorithmic performance of modern CNNs, however, fundamentally relies on learning class-agnostic hierarchical features that only exist in comprehensive training datasets with many classes. As a result, fast inference using CNNs trained on such datasets is prohibitive for most resource-constrained IoT platforms. To bridge this gap, we present a principled and practical methodology for distilling a complex modern CNN that is trained to effectively recognize many different classes of input data into an application-dependent essential core that not only recognizes the few classes of interest to the application accurately but also runs efficiently on platforms with limited resources. Experimental results confirm that our approach strikes a favorable balance between classification accuracy (application constraint), inference efficiency (platform constraint), and productive development of new applications (business constraint).},

Traditional target detection methods require cropping of the image, which leads to poor real-time detection and poor accuracy. To address these issues, we propose an improved defect detection method for YOLOv5s. We use the single-stage target detection network model YOLOv5s. Firstly, we design a set of small anchor frames with small target sizes. Second, we add a small target detection head to the network and fuse strong semantic information from the second layer of the network feature map. Third, we embed the CBAM module and the SPP module into the Neck layer of the network. the CBAM module helps the network to find regions of interest in the images. the SPP module fuses the multi-scale features of the targets. The purpose of the above three components is to solve the problem that small target features are easily lost. The experimental results show that the improved network has a precisi rate of 97.1\%, a recall rate of 89.1\%, an mAP0.5 of 94.5\% and an mAP0.5:0.95 of 48.5\%, all four metrics are higher than the YOLOv5s base model.},

In this paper, we propose a substantially enhanced closed visual query language, called PhyQL, that can be used to query phylogenetic databases represented in a canonical form. The canonical representation presented helps capture most phylogenetic tree formats in a convenient way, and is used as the storage model for our PhyloBase database for which PhyQL serves as the query language. We have implemented a visual interface for the end users to pose PhyQL queries using visual icons, and drag and drop operations defined over them. Once a query is posed, the interface translates the visual query into a Datalog query for execution over the canonical database. Responses are returned as hyperlinks to phylogenies that can be viewed in several formats using the tree viewers supported by PhyloBase. Results cached in PhyQL buffer allows secondary querying on the computed results making it a truly powerful querying architecture.},

	abstract = {Wearable cameras provide an objective method to visually confirm and automate the detection of health-risk behaviors such as smoking and overeating, which is critical for developing and testing adaptive treatment interventions. Despite the potential of wearable camera systems, adoption is hindered by inadequate clinician input in the design, user privacy concerns, and user burden. To address these barriers, we introduced HabitSense, an open-source1, multi-modal neck-worn platform developed with input from focus groups with clinicians (N=36) and user feedback from in-wild studies involving 105 participants over 35 days. Optimized for monitoring health-risk behaviors, the platform utilizes RGB, thermal, and inertial measurement unit sensors to detect eating and smoking events in real time. In a 7-day study involving 15 participants, HabitSense recorded 768 hours of footage, capturing 420.91 minutes of hand-to-mouth gestures associated with eating and smoking data crucial for training machine learning models, achieving a 92\% F1-score in gesture recognition. To address privacy concerns, the platform records only during likely health-risk behavior events using SECURE, a smart activation algorithm. Additionally, HabitSense employs on-device obfuscation algorithms that selectively obfuscate the background during recording, maintaining individual privacy while leaving gestures related to health-risk behaviors unobfuscated. Our implementation of SECURE has resulted in a 48\% reduction in storage needs and a 30\% increase in battery life. This paper highlights the critical roles of clinician feedback, extensive field testing, and privacy-enhancing algorithms in developing an unobtrusive, lightweight, and reproducible wearable system that is both feasible and acceptable for monitoring health-risk behaviors in real-world settings.},

	abstract = {Ever growing PCB industry requires automation during manufacturing process to produce defect free products. Machine Vision is widely used as popular means of inspection to find defects in PCBs. However, it is still largely dependent on user input to select algorithm set for the PCB under inspection prior to the beginning of the process. Continuous increase in computation power of computers and image quality of image acquisition devices demands new methods for further automation. This paper proposes a new method to achieve further automation by identifying the type of PCB under inspection prior to begin defect inspection process. Identification of PCB is achieved by using local feature detectors SURF and ORB and using the orientation data acquired to transform the PCB image to the reference image for inspection of defects. A close-loop system is produced as a prototype to reflect the practicality of the idea. A Graphical User Interface was developed using MATLAB to present the proposed system. Test data contained 29 PCBs. Each PCB was tested 5 times for camera acquired images and 3 times for database images. The identification accuracy is 98.66\% for database images and 100\% for images acquired from the camera. The time taken to detect the model of PCB is recorded and is significantly lower for ORB based identification than SURF based. The system is also a close loop system which detects defects in PCB units. The detection of defects has highest accuracy of 92.3\% for best controlled environment scenario. With controlled environment, the system could detect defects in PCB pertaining to smallest of components such as SMDs. Copyright © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {Since the inception of the Integrated Circuit (IC), the size of the transistors used to construct them has continually shrunk. While this advancement significantly improves computing capability, fabrication costs have skyrocketed. As a result, most IC designers must now outsource fabrication. Outsourcing, however, presents a security threat: comprehensive post-fabrication inspection is infeasible given the size of modern ICs, so it is nearly impossible to know if the foundry has altered the original design during fabrication (i.e., inserted a hardware Trojan). Defending against a foundry-side adversary is challenging because—even with as few as two gates—hardware Trojans can completely undermine software security. Researchers have attempted to both detect and prevent foundry-side attacks, but all existing defenses are ineffective against additive Trojans with footprints of a few gates or less. We present Targeted Tamper-Evident Routing (T-TER), a layout-level defense against untrusted foundries, capable of thwarting the insertion of even the stealthiest hardware Trojans. T-TER is directed and routing-centric: it prevents foundry-side attackers from routing Trojan wires to, or directly adjacent to, security-critical wires by shielding them with guard wires. Unlike shield wires commonly deployed for cross-talk reduction, T-TER guard wires pose an additional technical challenge: they must be tamper-evident in both the digital (deletion attacks) and analog (move and jog attacks) domains. We address this challenge by developing a class of designed-in guard wires that are added to the design specifically to protect security-critical wires. T-TER’s guard wires incur minimal overhead, scale with design complexity, and provide tamper-evidence against attacks. We implement automated tools (on top of commercial CAD tools) for deploying guard wires around targeted nets within an open-source System-on-Chip. Lastly, using an existing IC threat assessment toolchain, we show T-TER defeats even the stealthiest known hardware Trojan, with ≈ \&nbsp;1\% overhead.},

	abstract = {Payment card fraud is a growing problem in the United States. Credit and debit card numbers are harvested from automated devices such as fuel dispensers, Point of Sale (POS) terminals, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in a process known as "skimming". Skimming requires the installation of malicious hardware on (or inside of) the targeted device. As such, it serves as an example of a physical cyber threat. In this paper, we provide an overview of payment card skimming in general, before narrowing our focus to payment card skimming occurring at fuel pumps. We then reverse engineer skimmers which law enforcement has harvested from fuel pumps in Florida. We consider only those skimmers which use Bluetooth to exfiltrate the "skimmed" payment card data. The goals of our research are to analyze the internal operation of the skimmers and determine if they can be disabled wirelessly, without requiring the fuel pump cabinet to be opened.},

Despite the strong demand for accurate joint tracking, existing techniques, such as cameras, IMUs, and flex sensors, suffer from major limitations that include occlusion, cumulative error, and high cost. These issues collectively undermine the practicality of joint tracking.We introduce MagDot, a new magnetic-based joint tracking method that enables high-accuracy, drift-free, and wearable joint angle tracking. To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, MagDot employs a novel tracking scheme that compensates for various real-world impacts, achieving high tracking accuracy. We tested MagDot on eight participants with a professional motion capture system, i.e., Qualisys motion capture system with nine Arqus A12 cameras. The results indicate MagDot can accurately track major body joints. For example, MagDot can achieve tracking accuracy of 2.72°, 4.14°, and 4.61° for elbow, knee, and shoulder, respectively. With a power consumption of only 98 mW, MagDot can support one-day usage with a small battery pack.},

Users can then export these tags to other music streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Deezer, etc. Following a user-centric design process, a large in-the-wild study was conducted over several weeks to investigate the value of the Button in aiding listeners' discovery of music. One group of participants was given a mobile phone app designed to facilitate tagging music heard on BBC radio stations; two other groups were given both the app and a Button (in one of two hardware versions). The findings revealed that Button users made significantly more tags on average than app users, indicating that a physical device could add significant value for radio listeners who want to tag music. Participants valued the simple one-touch interaction method, especially in situations where their smartphones were out of reach or contextual constraints meant that interaction with a complex device was undesirable or difficult.},

The concept of automatic inspection contributes to the improvement of the manufacturing quality of PCBs and facilitates their approval or rejection. The Automatic Inspection System for Printed Circuit Boards (AIS-PCB) is developed with the capability to identify the defects and the quality of PCBs. It is based on a real time system machine vision. The developed AIS-PCB is capable of detecting, indexing and classifying by measuring the flux defects in PCBs during the re-flow of the real-time process. The AIS-PCB is The total automation control system is the core of the AIS-PCB. This system consist of vision inspection station, mechanical loader and unloader, final decision station and the pneumatic system handler. To detect and classify the quality of PCBs, segmentation in conjunction with Radon transform approaches are used for feature indexing and line detection based on the gradient field of PCB images. The Feed-Forward Back-Propagation (FFBP) model is used to classify the product quality of the PCBs via a learning concept. A number of trainings using the FFBP are performed to learn and match the targets. The images of each PCB classes are used as inputs to the classification module. The obtained results from the classification and rule decision are used to establish the receiver operating characteristic curve. The classifier, which is based on the proposed approach and is tested on the PCBs from a factory’s production line, achieves a sorting Coefficient Of Efficiency (COE {\textgreater} 95\%). The developed AIS-PCB system shows promising results in successfully segmenting and classifying flux defects in PCBs through computerized visual information and facilitates their automatic inspection, thereby aiding humans in conducting rapid inspections. © 2015 Ang Teoh Ong, Aouache Mustapha, Zulkifilie Bin Ibrahim, Suzaimah Ramli and Boo Chai Eong.},

Early AOI methods were based on classic image processing algorithms using a reference PCB. The traditional methods require very complex and inflexible preprocessing stages. With recent advances in the field of deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), automating various computer vision tasks has been established. Limited research has been carried out in the past on using CNN for AOI. The present systems are inflexible and require a lot of preprocessing steps or a complex illumination system to improve the accuracy. This paper studies the effectiveness of using CNN to detect soldering bridge faults in a PCB assembly.

The proposed CNN architecture is compared with the state-of-the-art object detection architecture, namely YOLO, with respect to detection accuracy, processing time, and memory requirement. The results of our experiments show that the proposed CNN architecture has a 3.0\% better average precision, has 50\% less number of parameters and infers in half the time as YOLO.

One critical step in their production process is detecting their defects. In this paper, we present an autonomous defect detection system for such products. In the system design, we face four challenges: first, molded pulp products come in various forms and sizes; second, defects are typically small and appear in different forms; third, detection must be fast enough to achieve desired high production rates; fourth, low cost is a key consideration in the pulp molding industry. To overcome these challenges, we have designed a defect detection system with an enhanced YOLOV5s + DeepLabV3Plus backbone and specific modules. Particularly, we design a lightweight YOLOV5s network with an attention mechanism to improve YOLOV5s' accuracy and speed, for roughly detecting and identifying the type and position of defects. We then utilize the DeepLabV3Plus segmentation model for precise detection. We deploy multiple cameras to handle the products of different sizes and forms, and design a spatial-information based method to eliminate the duplication in detection by different cameras. We have implemented our detection system in a real-world pulp molding manufacturing line, using cost-effective hardware. We have conducted extensive evaluation on our system, demonstrating that our system can meet molded pulp production requirements.},

However, traditional approaches built on handcrafted features, predefined rules, or thresholds are often susceptible to the variation of the acquired images’ quality and give unstable performances. To solve this problem, a deep learning-based soldering defect detection method is developed in this article. Like many real-life deep learning applications, the number of available training samples is often limited. This creates a challenging low-data scenario, as deep learning typically requires massive data to perform well. To address this issue, a multitask learning model is proposed, namely, PCBMTL, that can simultaneously learn the classification and segmentation tasks under low-data regimes. By acquiring the segmentation knowledge, classification performance is substantially improved with few samples. To facilitate the study, a soldering defect image dataset, namely, PCBSPDefect, is built. It focuses on the dual in-line packages (DIP) at the PCB back side, DIP at the PCB front side, and flat flexible cables. Experimental results show that the proposed PCBMTL outperforms the best existing approaches by over 5–17\% of average accuracy for different datasets. © 2023 The Authors.

A first experiment examines grip change and subjective preference when reaching for side targets using different fingers. Results show all locations can be reached with at least one finger, but the thumb and index are most preferred and require less grip change for positions along the sides. Two following experiments examine taps and flicks using the thumb and index finger in a new two-dimensional input space. A side-touch sensor is simulated with a combination of capacitive sensing and motion tracking to distinguish touches on the lower, middle, or upper edges. When tapping, index and thumb speeds are similar with thumb more accurate and comfortable, and the lower edge is most reliable with the middle edge most comfortable. When flicking with the thumb, the upper edge is fast and rated highly.},

In the electronics manufacturing industry, intensive variability in component shapes and colors, background brightness, and visual contrast between components and background results in difficulties in printed circuit board image classification. In this paper, we apply computer vision techniques to detect diverse electronic components from their background images, which is a challenging problem in electronics manufacturing industries because there are multiple types of components mounted on the same printed circuit board. Specifically, a 13-layer convolutional neural network (ECON) is proposed to detect electronic components either of a single category or of diverse categories. The proposed network consists of five Convolution-MaxPooling blocks, followed by a flattened layer and two fully connected layers. An electronic component image dataset from a real manufacturing company is applied to compare the performance between ECON, Xception, VGG16, and VGG19. In this dataset, there are 11 categories of components as well as their background images. Results show that ECON has higher accuracy in both single-category and diverse component classification than the other networks. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been proven to be capable of designing an optimal control theory by minimising the error in dynamic systems. However, in many of the real-world operations, the exact behaviour of the environment is unknown. In such environments, random changes cause the system to reach different states for the same action. Hence, application of DRL for unpredictable environments is difficult as the states of the world cannot be known for non-stationary transition and reward functions.In this paper, a mechanism to encapsulate the randomness of the environment is suggested using a novel bio-inspired homeostatic approach based on a hybrid of Receptor Density Algorithm (an artificial immune system based anomaly detection application) and a Plastic Spiking Neuronal model. DRL is then introduced to run in conjunction with the above hybrid model. The system is tested on a vehicle to autonomously re-position in an unpredictable environment. Our results show that the DRL based process control raised the accuracy of the hybrid model by 32\%.},

Furthermore, the competition between the electronic companies is fiercer than ever. In this sense, product quality is a key point in the company’s business plan.

Visual Inspection is one of the most important tools to ensure PCB quality in a manufacturing line. Considering the advances in computing systems, the Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) machines are replacing human operators in the visual inspection process. However, AOI machines usually still need highly trained operators, with knowledge of image processing, so there still has room for more automated processes using Artificial Intelligence, particularly considering the advances with Neural Networks.

	abstract = {The time for battery-free computing is now. Lithium mining depletes and pollutes local water supplies and dead batteries in landfills leak toxic metals into the ground[20][12]. Battery-free devices represent a probable future for sustainable ubiquitous computing and we will need many more new devices and programmers to bring that future into reality. Yet, energy harvesting and battery-free devices that frequently fail are challenging to program. The maker movement has organically developed a considerable variety of platforms to prototype and program ubiquitous sensing and computing devices, but only a few have been modified to be usable with energy harvesting and to hide those pesky power failures that are the norm from variable energy availability (platforms like Microsoft's Makecode and AdaFruit's CircuitPython). Many platforms, especially Arduino (the first and most famous maker platform), do not support energy harvesting devices and intermittent computing. To bridge this gap and lay a strong foundation for potential new platforms for maker programming, we build a tool called BOOTHAMMER: a lightweight assembly re-writer for ARM Thumb. BOOTHAMMER analyzes and rewrites the low-level assembly to insert careful checkpoint and restore operations to enable programs to persist through power failures. The approach is easily insertable in existing toolchains and is general-purpose enough to be resilient to future platforms and devices/chipsets. We close the loop with the user by designing a small set of program annotations that any maker coder can use to provide extra information to this low-level tool that will significantly increase checkpoint efficiency and resolution. These optional extensions represent a way to include the user in decision-making about energy harvesting while ensuring the tool supports existing platforms. We conduct an extensive evaluation using various program benchmarks with Arduino as our chosen evaluation platform. We also demonstrate the usability of this approach by evaluating BOOTHAMMER with a user study and show that makers feel very confident in their ability to write intermittent computing programs using this tool. With this new tool, we enable maker hardware and software for sustainable, energy-harvesting-based computing for all.},

As an alternative Joule heating method, we explore the potential of carbon nanomaterial heating paints, which enable the rapid generation of uniform heat at low voltages. We present simple fabrication methods for creating handmade heaters using off-the-shelf materials and cutting machines and demonstrate the feasibility of crafting heaters with complex shapes and grid-array configurations. Leveraging the heating paint’s compatibility with various materials, we showcase the versatile applications for interactive thermal displays, stiffness modulation devices, and pneumatic interfaces for stiffness-shape transformations.},

	abstract = {The quality of a printed circuit board (PCB) is paramount towards ensuring proper functionality of electronic products. To achieve the required quality standards, substantial research and development efforts were invested to automate PCB inspection for defect detection, primarily using computer vision techniques. Despite these advancements, the accuracy of such techniques is often susceptible towards varying board and component size. Efforts to increase its accuracy especially for small or tiny defects on a PCB often lead to a tradeoff with reduced real-time performance, which in turn limits its applicability in the manufacturing industry. Hence, this paper puts forward an enhanced deep learning network which addresses the difficulty in inferring tiny or varying defects on a PCB in real-time. Our proposed enhancements consist of i) A novel multi-scale feature pyramid network to enhance tiny defect detection through context information inclusion; and ii) A refined complete intersection over union loss function to precisely encapsulate tiny defects. Experimental results on a publicly available PCB defects dataset demonstrate that our model achieves 99.17\% mean-average precision, while maintaining real-time inferencing speed at 90 frames per second. In addition, we introduce three trend detection algorithms which alert an operator when abnormal development of defect characteristics is detected. Each algorithm is responsible for localizing defect buildups, increasing defect size and increasing defect occurrences, respectively. As a whole, the proposed model is capable of performing accurate and reliable real-time PCB inspection with the aid of an automated alert capability.

It is important because a wealth of public data repositories is available to drive biological and clinical research; combining information from various heterogeneous and widely dispersed sources is paramount to a number of biological discoveries. It is difficult because the domain is complex and there is no agreement among the various metadata definitions, which refer to different vocabularies and ontologies. It is well-recognized in the bioinformatics community because, in the common practice, repositories are accessed one-by-one, learning their specific metadata definitions as result of long and tedious efforts, and such practice is error-prone. In this paper, we describe META-BASE, an architecture for integrating metadata extracted from a variety of genomic data sources, based upon a structured transformation process. We present a variety of innovative techniques for data extraction, cleaning, normalization and enrichment. We propose a general, open and extensible pipeline that can easily incorporate any number of new data sources, and propose the resulting repository–already integrating several important sources–which is exposed by means of practical user interfaces to respond biological researchers’ needs.},

The practical success of excessively large networks underscores the need for better theoretical analyses and justifications. In this paper we focus on layer-wise functional structure and behavior in overparameterized deep models. To do so, we study empirically the layers' robustness to post-training re-initialization and re-randomization of the parameters. We provide experimental results which give evidence for the heterogeneity of layers. Morally, layers of large deep neural networks can be categorized as either "robust" or "critical". Resetting the robust layers to their initial values does not result in adverse decline in performance. In many cases, robust layers hardly change throughout training. In contrast, re-initializing critical layers vastly degrades the performance of the network with test error essentially dropping to random guesses. Our study provides further evidence that mere parameter counting or norm calculations are too coarse in studying generalization of deep models, and "flatness" and robustness analysis of trained models need to be examined while taking into account the respective network architectures.},

	abstract = {Deep learning methods have been extensively studied and have been proven to be very useful in multiple fields of technology. This paper presents a deep learning approach to optically detect hidden hardware trojans in the manufacturing and assembly phase of printed circuit boards to secure electronic supply chains. Trojans can serve as backdoors of accessing on chip data, can potentially alter functioning and in some cases may even deny intended service of the chip. Apart from consumer electronics, printed circuit boards are used in mission critical applications like military and space equipment. Security compromise or data theft can have severe impact and thus demand research attention. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can be implemented in a manufacturing environment with limited training data. It can also provide better coverage in detection of hardware trojans over traditional methods. Image recognition algorithms need to have deeper penetration inside the training layers for recognizing physical variations of image patches. However, traditional network architectures often face vanishing gradient problem when the network layers are added. This hampers the overall accuracy of the network. To solve this a Residual network with multiple layers is used in this article. The ResNet34 algorithm can identify manufacturing tolerances and can differentiate between a manufacturing defect and a hardware trojan. The ResNet operates on the fundamental principle of learning from the residual of the output of preceding layer. In the degradation issue, it is observed that, a shallower network performs better than deeper network. However, this is with the downside of lower accuracy. Thus, a skip connection is made to provide an alternative path for the gradient to skip forward the training of few layers and add in multiple repeating blocks to achieve higher accuracy and lower training times. Implementation of this method can bolster automated optical inspection setup used to detect manufacturing variances on a printed circuit board. The results show a 98.5\% accuracy in optically detecting trojans by this method and can help cut down redundancy of physically testing each board. The research results also provide a new consideration of hardware trojan benchmarking and its effect on optical detection. © Copyright © 2021 Kulkarni and Xu.},

	abstract = {Together with the curse of dimensionality, nonlinear dependencies in large data sets persist as major challenges in data mining tasks. A reliable way to accurately preserve nonlinear structure is to compute geodesic distances between data points. Manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, aim to preserve geodesic distances in a Riemannian manifold. However, as manifold learning algorithms operate on the ambient dimensionality of the data, the essential step of geodesic distance computation is sensitive to high-dimensional noise. Therefore, a direct application of these algorithms to high-dimensional, noisy data often yields unsatisfactory results and does not accurately capture nonlinear structure.We propose an unsupervised random forest approach called geodesic forests (GF) to geodesic distance estimation in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. GF operates on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full observed dimensionality. To choose the optimal split in a computationally efficient fashion, we developed Fast-BIC, a fast Bayesian Information Criterion statistic for Gaussian mixture models.We additionally propose geodesic precision and geodesic recall as novel evaluation metrics that quantify how well the geodesic distances of a latent manifold are preserved. Empirical results on simulated and real data demonstrate that GF is robust to high-dimensional noise, whereas other methods, such as Isomap, UMAP, and FLANN, quickly deteriorate in such settings. Notably, GF is able to estimate geodesic distances better than other approaches on a real connectome dataset.},

The YOLOv3-DenseNet is based on YOLOv3 with key improvements: firstly, the residual units in YOLOv3 are partially replaced by dense blocks to enhance the feature reuse of the networks; secondly, the loss function is revised by adopting the generalized intersection over union (GIOU) between the predicted box and the ground truth, to tackle the termination of optimization process when IOU is zero. Result comparison shows that the proposed YOLOv3-DenseNetoutperforms other commonly used YOLOv3 family models in term of recognition accuracy, while the model size is even smaller.},

It explains the development status in all aspects of smart manufacturing, via the example of ceramic circuit board manufacturing and electronic assembly, and outlines future smart manufacturing plans and processes. The research proposed two experiments using artificial intelligence and deep learning to demonstrate the problems and solutions regarding methods in manufacturing and factory facilities, respectively. In the first experiment, a Bayesian network inference is used to find the cause of the problem of metal residues between electronic circuits through key process and quality correlations. In the second experiment, a convolutional neural network is used to identify false defects that were overinspected during automatic optical inspection. This improves the manufacturing process by enhancing the yield rate and reducing cost. The contributions of the study built in circuit board production. Smart manufacturing, with the application of a Bayesian network to an Internet of Things setup, has addressed the problem of residue and redundant conductors on the edge of the ceramic circuit board pattern, and has improved and prevented leakage and high-frequency interference. The convolutional neural network and deep learning were used to improve the accuracy of the automatic optical inspection system, reduce the current manual review ratio, save labor costs, and provide defect classification as a reference for preprocess improvement.},

	abstract = {Inspection of defects in the printed circuit boards (PCBs) has both safety and economic significance in the 4.0 industrial manufacturing. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging problem to be studied in-depth due to the complexity of the PCB layouts and the shrinking down tendency of the electronic component size. In this paper, a real-time automated supervision algorithm is proposed to test the PCBs quality among different scenarios. The density of the PCBs layout and the complexity on the surface are analyzed based on deep learning and image feature extraction algorithms. To be more detailed, the ORB feature and the Brute-force matching method are utilized to match perfectly the input images with the PCB templates. After transferring images by aiding the RANSAC algorithm, a hybrid method using modern computer vision algorithms is developed to segment defective areas on the PCBs surface. Then, by applying the enhanced Residual Network-50, the proposed algorithm can classify the groove defects on the surface mount technology electronic components which minimum size up to 1×3 mm. After the training process, the proposed system is capable to categorize various types of overproduced, recycled, and cloned PCBs. The speed of the quality testing operation maintains at a high level with an average precision rate up to 96.29 \% in case of good brightness conditions. Finally, the computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed system based on deep learning can obtain superior results and it outperforms several existing works in terms of speed, precision, and robustness. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Quality control is a critical aspect of the modern electronic circuit industry. In addition to being a pre-requisite to proper functioning, circuit quality is closely related to safety, security, and economic issues. Quality control has been reached through system testing. Meanwhile, device miniaturization and multilayer Printed Circuit Boards have increased the electronic circuit test complexity considerably. Hence, traditional test processes based on manual inspections have become outdated and inefficient. More recently, the concept of Advanced Manufacturing or Industry 4.0 has enabled the manufacturing of customized products, tailored to the changing customers’ demands. This scenario points out additional requirements for electronic system testing: it demands a high degree of flexibility in production processes, short design and manufacturing cycles, and cost control. Thus, there is a demand for circuit testing systems that present effectiveness and accessibility without placing numerous test points. This work is focused on automated test solutions based on machine learning, which are becoming popular with advances in computational tools. We present a new testing approach that uses autoencoders to detect firmware or hardware anomalies based on the electric current signature. We built a test set-up using an embedded system development board to evaluate the proposed approach. We implemented six firmware versions that can run independently on the test board – one of them is considered anomaly-free. In order to obtain a reference frame to our results, two other classification techniques (a computer vision algorithm and a random forest classification model) were employed to detect anomalies on the same development board. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrated that the proposed test method is highly effective. For several test scenarios, the correct detection rate was above 99\%. Test results showed that autoencoder and random forest approaches are effective. However, random forests require all data classes to be trained. Training an autoencoder, on the other hand, only requires the reference (anomaly-free) class. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Addressing the performance and efficiency challenges of detecting small target defects on PCB (printed circuit board), this research proposes a lightweight inspection model for YOLOv8-based. The initial step involves employing an enhanced Efficient\_Detect network architecture with the aim of diminishing the volume of model parameters and computational intricacy, while simultaneously augmenting resource utilization. Then, the deformable convolutional networks v2 (DCNv2) are integrated into the C2f structure to improve feature extraction for defects with diverse shapes on the PCB surface, enhancing the model's capability to identify different categories of flaws. Meanwhile, the Inner-SIoU loss function is utilized instead of the conventional CIoU loss function to enhance both the precision of inspection and the robustness of the model. The enhanced approach achieves an mAP50 of 96.8\% and an mAP50-95 of 72.2\%, marking an improvement of 3.9\% and 10.1\%, respectively, comparison with base YOLOv8n model. In addition, the parameter counts of the model, GFLOPs, and weight size are notably reduced by 18.4\%, 33.3\%, and 19.7\%, respectively, resulting in final metrics of 2.34 M, 5.4 GFLOPs, and a weight size of 4.9 M. In addition, the detection speed can reach up to 161 FPS, which has the potential for real-time detection. It provides an efficient and lightweight PCB small target defect detection solution for scenarios with limited computing resources.},

	abstract = {Today, the process of producing a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) is growing rapidly, and this process requires cutting-edge debugging and testing of the boards. The Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) process detects defects in the boards, components, or solder pads using image processing and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Although state-of-the-art approaches for identifying defects are well developed, due to three main issues, the ML algorithms and datasets are incapable of fully integrating into industrial plants. These issues are privacy limitations for sharing data, the distribution shifts in the PCBA industry, and the absence of a degree of freedom for reproducible and modifiable synthetic datasets. This paper addresses these challenges and introduces “ReProInspect”, a comprehensive framework designed to meet these requirements. ReProInspect uses fabrication files from the designed PCBs in the manufacturing line to automatically generate 3D models of the PCBAs. By incorporating various techniques, the framework introduces controlled defects into the PCBA, thereby creating reproducible and differentiable defect datasets. The quality data produced by this framework enables an improved detection and classification scenario for AOI in industrial applications. The initial results of ReProInspect are demonstrated and discussed through detailed instances. Finally, the paper also highlights future work to improve the current state of the framework. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This system can decrease crew members’ input needed to operate the plant growth systems in deep space by providing autonomous monitoring, real-time data reporting, ambient environment management, automatic harvesting, and cleaning. Crops with high nutrient content, high acceptability ratings, dwarf growth habits, and short harvest cycles (Sugar Ann Snap Peas and Red Robin Tomato) will initially be grown in this modular system which has the potential to be scale up or down, depending on the mission. A variety of “pick and eat” crops can be grown to provide palatable, safe, nutritious foods that are familiar foods for crews to consume. To reduce resupply from Earth, the seeds from these crops have the potential to be saved and used to grow continuous generations of crops.},

Therefore, it is critical to detect and locate all defects on a FPC. Although great progress has been made in FPC defect detection, traditional detection methods are still difficult to deal with complex and diverse FPC. Therefore, this paper designs a depth model that can accurately detect FPC defects from non-detection templates and defect detection image input pairs. This method uses the multi-scale pyramid hierarchy structure inherent in deep neural network (DNN) to construct multi-scale characteristics. First of all, k-means clustering is used to design reasonable anchor points. Then, the network strengthens the relationship between the feature mapping at different levels and the advantages of the underlying structure information and is suitable for the detection of minor defects. The experimental results show that the accuracy of defect detection is improved effectively.},

	abstract = {In various applications, such as computer vision, medical imaging, and robotics, three-dimensional (3D) image registration is a significant step. It enables the alignment of various datasets into a single coordinate system, consequently providing a consistent perspective that allows further analysis. By precisely aligning images, we can compare, analyze, and combine data collected in different situations. This paper presents a novel approach for 3D or z-stack microscopy and medical image registration, utilizing a combination of conventional and deep learning techniques for feature extraction and adaptive likelihood-based methods for outlier detection. The proposed method uses the Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and the Residual Network (ResNet50) deep neural learning network to extract effective features and obtain precise and exhaustive representations of image contents. The registration approach also employs the adaptive Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple Consensus (MLESAC) method that optimizes outlier detection and increases noise and distortion resistance to improve the efficacy of these combined extracted features. This integrated approach demonstrates robustness, flexibility, and adaptability across a variety of imaging modalities, enabling the registration of complex images with higher precision. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art image registration methods, including conventional SIFT, SIFT with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) methods, as well as registration software packages such as bUnwrapJ and TurboReg, in terms of Mutual Information (MI), Phase Congruency-Based (PCB) metrics, and Gradiant-based metrics (GBM), using 3D MRI and 3D serial sections of multiplex microscopy images.},

Although these tools have enabled a completely new set of users to take part in manufacturing, they are still limited in their use and the workflows they provide. As an answer to this, users are modifying and customizing their machines by changing the work envelope and adding different end-effectors. However, customizing, modifying and creating digital fabrication machines require extensive knowledge within multiple different engineering domains, and is non-trivial. In this paper, we present The Fabricatable Axis, a high-level parametric model that aims to simplify the process of experimenting, customizing and implementing digital fabrication machines. This model encapsulates the knowledge of an experienced machine designer into a model that less experienced machine builders can use to design and customize linear and rotary motion axes which can be combined into different machines. The model receives high-level input parameters such as axis type, length and speed-parameters, and outputs a CAD model of a motion axis consisting of fabricatable parts (parts that are readily available or parts that can be fabricated using accessible tools such as a CNC milling machine). To validate our contribution, we first present a constructed scenario were we use the model to implement a specific machine. Secondly, we present an evaluation of our tool through a series of interviews with users who have been using the model to create different types of machines.},

Especially soldering splashes in some areas of PCB (printed circuit board) can cause change of selected electrical parameters. Nowadays, the manual inspection is massively replaced by specialized visual systems checking the presence of different defects. The research carried out in this paper can be considered as industrial (industry requested) application of machine learning in automated object detection. Object of interest—solder splash—is characterized by its small area and similar properties (texture, color) as its surroundings. The aim of our research was to apply state-of-the art algorithms based on deep neural networks for detection such objects in relatively complex electronic board. The research compared seven different object detection models based on you-look-only-once (YOLO) and faster region based convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that our custom trained YOLOv8n detection model with 1.9 million parameters can detect solder splashes with low detection speed 90 ms and 96.6\% mean average precision.

	abstract = {Setting up a large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is challenging, as firmware must be distributed and trust between sensor nodes and a backend needs to be established. To perform this task efficiently, we propose an approach named Box, which utilizes an intelligent Faraday Cage (FC). The FC acquires firmware images and secret keys from a backend, patches the firmware with the keys and deploys those customized images over-the-air (OTA) to sensor nodes placed in the FC. Electromagnetic (EM) shielding protects this exchange against passive attackers. We place few demands on the sensor node, not requiring additional hardware components or firmware customized by the manufacturer. We describe this novel workflow, implement the Box and a backend system and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by batch-deploying firmware to multiple commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor nodes. We conduct a user-study with 31 participants with diverse backgrounds and find, that our approach is both faster and more user-friendly than firmware distribution over a wired connection.},

	abstract = {Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are very important parts for almost every electronical device since they are the most frequently used interconnection technology for components in electronic products. Due to that fact, the reliability of PCB is very important. In order to guarantee the quality of a PCB, the single manufacturing steps have to be monitored. One of the most important manufacturing steps is the tinning process of the copper pads using hot air leveling. The importance of this process lies in the fact that oxidization of the copper pads has to be avoided, and the solderability of the PCB needs to be ensured. For this reason, uncoated copper pads must be prevented. In a previous study a model for the automatic detection of uncoated copper pads has been developed using a patch-based classifier. The model showed good results, but the approach was not suitable to be implemented in an industrial application. In this present study an instance segmentation approach was used to tackle the problem. The basis of the model is a R-CNN with mask prediction that has to be trained using image data. A PCB inspection unit was employed to generate the image data. Due to the high expense of the instance labeling, an approach adopted from active learning was used as strategy to select images that extend the training dataset efficiently. Evaluation of the developed model shows, that the great majority of defects is detected correctly. The future goal is to improve the model such that it can be included in an automatic fault detection system as part of an online quality control unit in the manufacturing process of PCBs. © ESREL 2021.

	abstract = {Electronic devices are increasingly the subject of inspection by authorities. While encryption hides secret messages, it does not hide the transmission of those secret messages—in fact, it calls attention to them. Thus, an adversary, seeing encrypted data, turns to coercion to extract the credentials required to reveal the secret message. Steganographic techniques hide secret messages in plain sight, providing the user with plausible deniability, removing the threat of coercion. This paper unveils Invisible Bits a new steganographic technique that hides secret messages in the analog domain of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) embedded within a computing device. Unlike other memory technologies, the power-on state of SRAM reveals the analog-domain properties of its individual cells. We show how to quickly and systematically change the analog-domain properties of SRAM cells to encode data in the analog domain and how to reveal those changes by capturing SRAM's power-on state. Experiments with commercial devices show that Invisible Bits provides over 90\% capacity—two orders-of-magnitude more than previous on-chip steganographic approaches, while retaining device functionality—even when the device undergoes subsequent normal operation or is shelved for months. Experiments also show that adversaries cannot differentiate between devices with encoded messages and those without. Lastly, we show how to layer encryption and error correction on top of our message encoding scheme in an end-to-end demonstration.},

To overcome the obstacle that dynamic factors are hard to obtain in some scenarios, the proposed framework employs unsupervised learning to analyze their patterns and extract time-invariant features for modeling. A validation study is conducted on the estimation of distribution center sorting times.

	abstract = {Deep Learning has been shown to be particularly vulnerable to adversarial samples. To combat adversarial strategies, numerous defensive techniques have been proposed. Among these, a promising approach is to use randomness in order to make the classification process unpredictable and presumably harder for the adversary to control. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of randomized defenses against adversarial samples. To this end, we categorize existing state-of-the-art adversarial strategies into three attacker models of increasing strength, namely blackbox, graybox, and whitebox (a.k.a. adaptive) attackers. We also devise a lightweight randomization strategy for image classification based on feature squeezing, that consists of pre-processing the classifier input by embedding randomness within each feature, before applying feature squeezing. We evaluate the proposed defense and compare it to other randomized techniques in the literature via thorough experiments. Our results indeed show that careful integration of randomness can be effective against both graybox and blackbox attacks without significantly degrading the accuracy of the underlying classifier. However, our experimental results offer strong evidence that in the present form such randomization techniques cannot deter a whitebox adversary that has access to all classifier parameters and has full knowledge of the defense. Our work thoroughly and empirically analyzes the impact of randomization techniques against all classes of adversarial strategies.},

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of automation and intelligence in the electronics manufacturing industry, the throughput of a single production line was grown exponentially. Although high efficiency brought significant cost and time advantages, it also led to two major challenges: (1) extremely low tolerance for error—any slight defect might have caused the entire product to be scrapped; (2) increasingly diverse and more concealed types of defects—bubble defects, internal chip defects, printed circuit board (PCB) defects, and specific process defects were continuously emerged, posing significant challenges to the inspection process. Traditional manual visual inspection or single-task deep learning models were often struggled to balance detection efficiency and accuracy in complex industrial scenarios. To address the above challenges, a single-stage industrial defect detection model based on multi-dataset mixed training—MSAN-Net—was proposed in this paper. Representative datasets covering the typical scenarios mentioned above were collected and organized, and part of the data was re-annotated to ensure a high level of consistency with actual production environments. MSAN-Net was adopted an integrated architecture, deeply combining UnifiedViT, C2f modules, convolution operations, SPPF structure, and Bi-Level Routing Attention mechanism to achieve accurate identification of complex industrial defects. Extensive experiments (including comparisons with multiple methods, ablation studies, and external validation) showed that MSAN-Net was outperformed existing SOTA models in industrial defect detection tasks, significantly improving detection accuracy for multi-class defects in complex scenarios, reducing reliance on manual inspection, and effectively lowering scrap losses caused by defects, thus providing a reliable solution for intelligent quality inspection in the electronics manufacturing industry. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart healthcare has been applied in many fields such as disease surveillance and telemedicine, etc. However, there are some challenges for device deployment, data collection and guarantee of stainability in regional disease surveillance. First, it is difficult to deploy sensors and adjust the sensor network in unknown region for dynamic disease surveillance. Second, the limited life-cycle of sensor network may cause the loss of surveillance data. Thus, it is important to provide a sustainable and robust regional disease surveillance system. Given a set of Disease surveillance Area (DsA)s and Point of disease Surveillance (PoS)s, some sensors are deployed to monitor these PoSs, and a drone collect data from the sensors as well as charge the sensors to extend their life-cycles. The drone replenish its energy by relying on the bus network. We first formulate the drone assisted regional disease surveillance problem under the constraints of life-cycle of sensors and energy of drone, and propose an approximation algorithm to find a feasible cycle of drone to minimize the traveling time cost of drone. To satisfy the diversity requirements and dynamic scalability of regional disease surveillance, we deploy one robot in each DsA instead of sensors. We further formulate the learning transferable driven regional disease surveillance problem, and propose a joint schedule algorithm of drone and robots. The results of both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the total time cost by 39.71 and 48.74 percent, average waiting time by 42.00 and 50.14 percent, and increase the average accessing ratio of PoSs by 15.53 and 22.30 percent, through the assistance of bus network and learning transferable features.},

In this approach, each protein structure is represented by a subspace from the image set. The similarity between two protein structures is then characterized by the canonical angles between the two subspaces. The primary advantage of our method is that precise alignment is not needed. We employed Grassmann Discriminant Analysis GDA as the subspace-based learning in the classification framework. We applied our method for the classification problem of seven SCOP structural classes of protein 3D structures. The proposed method outperformed the k-nearest neighbor method k-NN based on conventional alignment-based methods CE, FATCAT, and TM-align.

Traditional manual inspections are inefficient and error-prone, while existing automated models struggle to identify small defects and operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments. We propose the Lightweight Guided and Shared Feature Fusion Network (LGSF-Net), integrating StarNet-based feature extraction, Adaptive Guided Feature Module (AGFM), and Shared Feature Detection (SFD) head. LGSF-Net achieves superior accuracy for small and medium-sized defects at just 3.0 megabyte (MB) and 139 frames per second (FPS), enabling real-time deployment on mobile platforms including drones. Our experiments show LGSF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models including You Only Look Once version 10 (YOLOv10), Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), and You Only Look Once version 11 (YOLO11) while requiring 42 \% fewer parameters and 35 \% lower computational resources. LGSF-Net achieves 93.7 \% average precision (AP) on our Aircraft Skin Defect Dataset and demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization on Steel Surface Defect with 85.7 \% AP, Printed Circuit Board with 95.2 \% AP, and Vision Drone 2019 with 39.6 \% AP. This versatility makes LGSF-Net a transformative solution for aviation maintenance, with applications for automated drone-based inspection systems and potential to significantly reduce aircraft downtime, maintenance costs, and human error. Despite minor limitations under extreme conditions, LGSF-Net bridges the critical gap between detection accuracy and resource efficiency in safety-critical inspection workflows. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

Due to their miniaturization and disguise characteristics, hidden voice recorders are difficult to notice. In this article, we present DeHiREC, the first proof-of-concept system capable of detecting offline hidden voice recorders from their electromagnetic radiations (EMR). We first characterize the unique patterns of the emanated EMR signals and then locate the EMR source, i.e., the analog-to-digital converter module embedded in the mixed signal system-on-chips. Since these unintentional EMR signals can be extremely noisy and weak, accurately detecting them can be challenging. To address this challenge, we design an EMR Catalyzing method to actively stimulate the EMR signals and then employ an adaptive-folding algorithm to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensed EMRs. We evaluate the performance of DeHiREC on 18 commercial voice recorders under various impacts, including interference from other devices. Experimental results reveal that DeHiREC is effective in detecting all 18 voice recorders and achieves an overall success rate of 94.72\% and a recall rate of 92.03\% at a distance of 0.2\&nbsp;m.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of precision electronics manufacturing, electronic products are increasingly integrated. PCB (printed circuit board) integrated circuits, especially ultra-large-scale integrated circuits in the information industry have become more and more important. And in the field of precision instruments, the requirements of PCB products are even higher. The process of the PCB product is complex and prone to stub defects, slope defects, false solder, less tin and other surface defects. In practical industrial scenarios, deep-learning based AI industrial vision can solve the above defect detection problems in PCB production process, but AI industrial vision technology exist some problems such as high real-time requirement, business fragmentation, edge data heterogeneity, privacy security and data silos in the process of factory production line application. Based on 5G customized network, Sedna platform and industrial quality inspection AI model technology, this paper sinks AI capabilities to industrial production lines through MEC, builds industrial-grade machine vision solutions, and creates a single-industry multi-plant intelligent industrial life-form ecology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Domain mismatch is a common problem in speaker verification (SV) and often causes performance degradation. For the system relying on the Gaussian PLDA backend to suppress the channel variability, the performance would be further limited if there is no Gaussianity constraint on the learned embeddings. This paper proposes an information-maximized variational domain adversarial neural network (InfoVDANN) that incorporates an InfoVAE into domain adversarial training (DAT) to reduce domain mismatch and simultaneously meet the Gaussianity requirement of the PLDA backend. Specifically, DAT is applied to produce speaker discriminative and domain-invariant features, while the InfoVAE performs variational regularization on the embedded features so that they follow a Gaussian distribution. Another benefit of the InfoVAE is that it avoids posterior collapse in VAEs by preserving the mutual information between the embedded features and the training set so that extra speaker information can be retained in the features. Experiments on both SRE16 and SRE18-CMN2 show that the InfoVDANN outperforms the recent VDANN, which suggests that increasing the mutual information between the embedded features and input features enables the InfoVDANN to extract extra speaker information that is otherwise not possible.},

	abstract = {A dialogue system will often ask followup clarification questions when interacting with a user if the agent is unsure how to respond. In this new study, we explore deep reinforcement learning RL for asking followup questions when a user records a meal description, and the system needs to narrow down the options for which foods the person has eaten. We build off of prior work in which we use novel convolutional neural network models to bypass the standard feature engineering used in dialogue systems to handle the text mismatch between natural language user queries and structured database entries, demonstrating that our model learns semantically meaningful embedding representations of natural language. In this new nutrition domain, the followup clarification questions consist of possible attributes for each food that was consumed; for example, if the user drinks a cup of milk, the system should ask about the percent milkfat. We investigate an RL agent to dynamically follow up with the user, which we compare to rule-based and entropy-based methods. On a held-out test set, assuming the followup questions are answered correctly, deep RL significantly boosts top five food recall from 54.9\% without followup to 89.0\%. We also demonstrate that a hybrid RL model achieves the best perceived naturalness ratings in a human evaluation.},

A key component is the management of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), which are integral components of electronic devices and have an operational lifespan of 15 years. However, on average, electrical equipment is discarded after 5 years due to individual defects, prompting the EU to enforce regulations supporting the right to repair. Although industrial remanufacturing of PCBs could be a viable solution, it is not currently feasible due to the complex inspection process required. This paper presents a novel inspection process approach based on data fusion of thermography, current measurement and optical inspection using artificial intelligence. The result is intelligent diagnostics in less time and with lower investment costs. In addition to the concept, initial investigations with real industrial applications in the field of automation are presented. © 2025 The Author(s).},

This work presents an automatic visual inspection approach for defect detection in turbo vanes in the investment casting industry. The proposed method uses RANSAC for robust line and circle detection to extract relevant information to discriminate between a good part and a defected one. Then, using this data a feature vector is created serving as input to a SVM classifier that after the training phase is able to discriminate and classify between a good sample or not. To test the proposed approach a private database was created containing 650 turbo vanes (which gives 2600 different samples to train and test). On this database the proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 99.96\%, an average false negative rate of 0.00\% and an average false positive rate of 0.05\%, using a 5-fold cross validation protocol, which demonstrates the success of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed image processing pipeline was deployed into Raspberry Pi 4 Model B part of a visual inspection machine, and is working daily at ZCP – Zollern and Comandita Portugal, which proves the method's robustness.},

For this purpose, the OpenCV library on Python is used to detect the region of interest within the image prior to the analysis and classification of the convolutional neural network ResNET50. Two types of faults were presented as lack of solder and solder bridge. The results obtained in the experimental classification tests have an accuracy margin higher than 90\%.

This study contributes in three ways: First, a 4-step improved method used for corner detection is introduced, which builds on the well-known FAST corner detection method. Second, the nearest and next nearest neighbor ratio method, bidirectional matching method and RANSAC are adopted to reduce the possibility of mismatching and optimize the performance of the corner matching. Third, several corner detection methods are compared. Performances in terms of quantitative and qualitative results are discussed so as to move towards the selection of the most appropriate method. The experiments demonstrate that the improved image stitching method outperforms other methods both in efficiency and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Accurate defect detection in industrial automated optical inspection (AOI) is crucial as it directly affects product quality and production efficiency. Although numerous techniques have been developed for industrial defect detection, most of them rely on single-texture image data. This dependence limits the accuracy and robustness of the defect detection due to inadequate optical source information. To overcome the problem of low accuracy owing to the lack of 3D topographic information, a multidimensional information fusion (MIF) module is proposed that fuses texture image and depth image features. The MIF module includes tailored mechanisms to fully extract complementary semantic information from space and channel dimensions. A hierarchical fusion strategy further improves feature integration by enabling higher-layer feature fusion via lower-layer Transformer blocks and efficiently removing redundant features. Afterward, feature extraction is performed on the fused feature map, and output is obtained. To enhance the detection accuracy, the position information mask (PIM) module is introduced for post-processing. The PIM module uses surface mount devices (SMDs) position data from Gerber files to create a position information mask. The mask helps filter out defects that are often misidentified owing to missing design information. The results of the comparative experiments demonstrate that the average accuracy of our method on the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) defect dataset is 99.93\%, which is 5.64\% higher than that of conventional YOLOV5. Furthermore, a comprehensive ablation study is conducted to elucidate the contribution of the proposed MIF and PIM modules. It demonstrated that the present model serves as a valuable reference for PCBA surface defect detection. © 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 is currently transforming the industrial landscape through the use of innovative technologies and novel data management approaches. The incorporation of Industry 4.0 brought new dimensions of improvement and autonomy into the existing industrial manufacturing processes which has also led to increased expectations for traceability in manufacturing. Traceability enables the tracking of every part and product of the manufacturing process giving insights into each manufactured component and its full history across each operation step that helps manufacturers improve quality and efficiency. Despite the huge potential in facilitating the optimization of the production lines, product traceability has remained a challenging topic in mass manufacturing. Hence, in this paper, an innovative Blockchain-based framework is proposed to integrate the processes of a real production line using the Industry 4.0 Festo Cyber-Physical Factory located at London Digital Twin Research Centre, Middlesex University. Blockchain technology is a distributed and shared database of events for a product life cycle that is encrypted in blocks or smaller data units. This paper introduces a viable blockchain-based framework implemented within a real smart product assembly for internal traceability within the production process in order to improve the security by preventing counterfeiting, identify specific problems on the production line and provide objective proof for product quality assurance.},

This article aims to provide stable visual guidance for operators to identify electronic components on printed circuit board (PCB) images during the manufacturing and maintenance processes, using graph techniques to enhance the efficiency of component localization. A three-stage approach is proposed to achieve this objective. First, a method based on graph neural networks is introduced for electronic component detection, trained exclusively on the public FISC-PCB dataset. Second, the registration of the physical location with PCB images is modeled as a Markov Chain, and a fast subgraph matching algorithm is proposed to reduce time and space complexities by leveraging a second-order attribute similarity approximation. Finally, the random sample consensus algorithm is employed to eliminate outliers and calculate geometric relationships, enabling accurate positioning. The proposed framework is evaluated using ten PCB images captured by line-scan cameras or mobile phone cameras and compared with leading contemporary methods. The various experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in localization accuracy and meets the requirements of efficiency and space utilization. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates cyber-physical attacks on avionics data buses, specifically focusing on the ARINC 429 protocol. The objective is to demonstrate how message injection, modification, and deletion attacks can be executed, enabling an attacker to gain full control over the transmitted data. In a real-world scenario, such an attack could have a devastating impact on the safety and functionality of an aircraft. For example, an attacker could manipulate critical flight data transmitted to avionics systems, leading to incorrect navigation, altitude, or speed information. In extreme cases, this could result in dangerous situations, including collisions or loss of control, endangering the lives of passengers and crew. To accomplish this, we propose a method that involves modifying messages on the data bus without segmenting it. This is achieved by developing an implant that acts as a physical tap into the data bus. In our experimental setup, the implant is positioned on the same bus as the Flight Management Computer (FMC) and a radar altimeter. Through our research, we demonstrate the ease with which this attack can be deployed using a data bus maintenance receptacle located in the Equipment and Electronics (E\&amp;E) or the avionics bay. Our findings highlight the critical vulnerability posed by such attacks and emphasize the need for robust security measures to protect avionics data buses. In a worst-case scenario, the impact of such an attack could lead to a loss situational awareness and potentially severe consequences, including accidents, loss of life, and significant financial losses for airlines and passengers. Therefore, it is imperative to address these vulnerabilities and develop effective countermeasures to mitigate the risks associated with cyber-physical attacks on avionics systems, particularly data buses.},

	abstract = {Non-destructive testing (NDT) is vital for product safety, quality, and compliance in various industries. It enables early flaw detection, cost-effective maintenance, and customer satisfaction. NDT encompasses technologies like vision testing, radiation testing, ultrasonic testing, and magnetic testing, which are tailored to specific requirements such as environment, size, and material of the specimen. We present concurrent photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for non-destructive inspection of printed circuit boards (PCBs). PCBs are integral to electronic products, contributing to their miniaturization and portability. Due to the small size of RLC components within PCBs, high-resolution NDT methods are essential. PAI combines optical excitation and ultrasonic detection based on light absorption, while OCT is a purely optical imaging technique based on interference of backscattered signals. By combining PAI and OCT, we can simultaneously obtain complementary information on light absorption and scattering. However, the development of a dual-modality system combining PAI and OCT is challenging due to the opacity of conventional ultrasonic transducers. To overcome this challenge, we have developed an optically transparent ultrasound transducer for coaxial combination of PAI and OCT. Our approach successfully detects anomalies such as internal thin layer delamination and internal wire disconnection that are difficult to visually observe within PCBs, providing high-resolution PA and OCT images. In particular, unlike conventional pure optical imaging methods, PAI and OCT are depth-resolved 3D volumetric images so that internal defects can be investigated through comprehensive information in the depth direction of the sample. This dual-modality using PAI and OCT for NDT holds great promise for inspecting various specimens, including PCBs, and contributes to enhanced quality control and reliability. © 2024 SPIE.},

Due to the small size of these defects, traditional detection methods are often inefficient and may suffer from missed or false detections. To address these problems,this paper proposes a small object defect detection method based on improved You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) algorithm. In the proposed method, all convolutional layers in the backbone network are replaced with Selective Attention Convolution (SAConv), offering higher precision and faster speed. By leveraging its large receptive field and extensive spatial perception, SAConv improves the feature extraction capabilities for small defects. An attention mechanism is introduced in the neck structure to enhance the focus on low-level features. Besides, a small object detection layer is added to obtain larger feature maps, improving the detection accuracy of the model. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in detecting steel surface defects.},

Throughout the manufacturing process, irregularities or defects often occur during drilling, etching, stripping, and other stages, impacting the performance and functionality of the circuit board. Many of these defects are related to soldering pads and copper balance, identifying them through manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone. This necessitates the use of Automated Optical Inspection (AOI). Practices like template matching often require two identical PCBs, which are compared using mathematical algorithms to detect differences. However, they are not resilient to viewpoint variations and non-rigid deformations. The current inspection process primarily focuses on rectifying PCB images captured with tilts ranging from 0° to 84° using homography principles. This correction process operates within a maximum run time of 7.96 s. The adjusted images then undergo analysis via a pattern-matching unit, where the system receives images of the same PCB pattern, each exhibiting different defects. Structural information mapping is performed using various spatial-domain feature-based matching algorithms. When evaluated using SSI and MSE metrics, the model achieved high matching percentages of 99.67\%, 99.75\%, and 99.30\%, and low error rates of 0.343\%, 0.358\%, and 0.721\% for three different types of PCB designs considered. Additionally, the model excels in precisely identifying the location of defects in the PCB images without using bounding boxes, in accordance with the description of the co-images through a segmentation approach. Overall, the proposed system effectively corrects skew, accurately detects abnormalities and outperforms traditional assessment systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the progression of smart workshop production in Printed Circuit Board(PCB )manufacturing, a crucial segment of the electronics industry, the demand for computing resources has surged. In the PCB manufacturing process, computing tasks such as quality inspection and predictive maintenance are closely intertwined with traditional production tasks, jointly affecting workshop efficiency. For example, in processes such as soldering, electroplating, and drilling during PCB manufacturing, multiple steps require intelligent visual inspection to guarantee product quality. However, existing workshop-related scheduling methods merely concentrate on the single allocation or scheduling of either production resources or computational resources, without comprehensively considering the collaborative utilization of these heterogeneous workshop resources. To address this issue, this article presents a collaborative scheduling and optimization model for production and inspection resources in an intelligent PCB manufacturing environment. We propose the STCSA algorithm, which utilizes intelligent optimization and computational offloading to balance tasks without relying on logistics. An improved STCSA rescheduling mechanism is also introduced to handle production disruptions. Benchmark and large-scale production evaluations demonstrate that STCSA outperforms enhanced GA and PSO in collaborative resource scheduling, significantly reducing overall production time and enhancing efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Quality inspection of solder connections in electronic circuit manufacturing is commonly performed using automatic optical inspection (AOI) technology. The utilization of deep learning in AOI has demonstrated high accuracy and fast computation, yet it requires expensive graphics processing unit (GPU) equipped computers. To enable broader and more cost-effective utilization, there is a need for an AOI model that can be embedded in simple central processing unit (CPU) based computers. To pursue this objective, several research efforts have been undertaken to develop AOI models based on classical machine learning techniques. However, the accuracy and speed achieved by these models have not yet matched deep learning-based AOI models. This study aims to enhance the computational efficiency of classic machine learning by processing only pixels containing textural information. The effectiveness enhancement is achieved through the application of log-polar transformation in the extraction of texture features using the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to detect defects in trough hole technology (THT) solder joint connections. By transforming cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates, the textural areas to be detected assume a square shape, facilitating efficient texture feature extraction. To ensure a significant improvement in performance, a comparative performance evaluation is conducted on classic machine learning-based AOI models with and without the log-polar transformation. The texture features extracted from both models are classified using the support vector machine (SVM) method. Model testing and evaluation reveals that the proposed enhancement effort is capable of increasing accuracy levels to 95\% and reach computation time by 120 milliseconds. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

	abstract = {LiDAR technology holds vast potential across various sectors, including robotics, autonomous driving, and urban planning. However, the performance of current LiDAR sensors is hindered by limited field of view (FOV), low resolution, and lack of flexible focusing capability. We introduce αLiDAR, an innovative LiDAR system that employs controllable actuation to provide a panoramic FOV, high resolution, and adaptable scanning focus. The core concept of αLiDAR is to expand the operational freedom of a LiDAR sensor through the incorporation of a controllable, active rotational mechanism. This modification allows the sensor to scan previously inaccessible blind spots and focus on specific areas of interest in an adaptive manner. By modeling uncertainties in LiDAR rotation process and estimating point-wise uncertainty, αLiDAR can correct point cloud distortions resulted from significant rotation. In addition, by optimizing LiDAR's rotation trajectory, αLiDAR can swiftly adapt to dynamic areas of interest. We developed several prototypes of αLiDAR and conducted comprehensive evaluations in various indoor and outdoor real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate that αLiDAR achieves centimeter-level pose estimation accuracy, with an average latency of only 37 ms. In two typical LiDAR applications, αLiDAR significantly enhances 3D mapping accuracy, coverage, and density by 8.5×, 2×, and 1.6× respectively, compared to conventional LiDAR sensors. Additionally, αLiDAR's adaptive rotation improves the effective sensing distance by 1.8× and increases the number of perceived objects by 1.9×.

One of the main challenges for researches who largely work with PCBs is the correct functionality of the board. As many PCBs face discontinuity within their component connections, solders connection as a result of heat etc. it is important to ensure the correct and efficient detection of any discontinuity with such boards. Currently one of the main methods of detecting such discontinuity is the visual inspection by the technicians, which can be time consuming and the accuracy cannot be totally guaranteed. One of the main discontinuity within a board can be named as an occurrence of crack which can occur due to an incorrect soldering, or even incorrect component placement. The current research proposes a non-destructive detection method for such breakouts or defects within a board without any need of schematic plan and with the help of Image Processing Technique. This is done by taking a simple but high resolution grayscale image by shining a light onto the surface of the PCB and then producing an image. This is followed by analysis of the image and recognizing any present defect that is typically done by human operator. This method, in comparison to the conventional and current methods can be faster and more accurate. Copyright © British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing, NDT 2019. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In humanoid robot soccer, the capacity to precisely track a ball is a crucial problem that is made challenging by processing limits and the subsequent inability to interpret all data from a high-definition image. This research suggests a method for locating and sizing balls in a computationally effective field setting. This research presents an enhanced, Faster Region-Based CNN-based deep learning architecture for multi-class ball and goal recognition. The proposed framework incorporates improved Faster RCNN model development, data argumentation, ball and goal image library building, and performance assessment. This study is a pioneer in employing 1000 real-world photographs to build a multi-labeled image class ball and goal. The convolutional and pooling layers are also improved for more precise and quick identification. The test findings reveal that the suggested method outperformed conventional detectors regarding detecting accuracy and processing speed. It has excellent potential for use in developing an autonomous, real-time image recognition system for humanoid robots.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the PCB manufacturing industry, there is an increasing demand for computer vision inspection to detect defects during production. Improving the accuracy and generalization of PCB defect detection models remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a high-precision, robust, and real-time end-to-end method for PCB defect detection based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Traditional methods often suffer from low accuracy and limited applicability. We propose a novel approach combining YOLOv5 and multiscale modules for hierarchical residual-like connections. In PCB defect detection, noise can confuse the background and small targets. The YOLOv5 model provides a strong foundation with its real-time processing and accurate object detection capabilities. The multi-scale module extends traditional approaches by incorporating hierarchical residual-like connections within a single block, enabling multiscale feature extraction. This plug-and-play module significantly enhances performance by extracting features at multiple scales and levels, which are useful for identifying defects of varying sizes and complexities. Our multi-scale architecture integrates feature extraction, defect localization, and classification into a unified network. Experiments on a large-scale PCB dataset demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to existing methods.

AMRs are becoming increasingly popular as they offer precise and efficient movement of payloads and can perform various tasks, potentially reducing the need for humans to engage in repetitive and arduous work. The AMR is designed with the view that it can potentially be used for educational, research, and development purposes. While there are many mobile robots available on the market, they are often expensive and come with proprietary hardware and software, which impacts the flexibility needed for research and development. To address these issues, we propose an affordable design for AMRs that utilizes ROS and advanced sensors, including LiDAR, Tracking Camera, Depth Camera, and IMU, for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation. The proposed design can assist researchers by offering a low-cost solution for developing and testing mobile robots with advanced capabilities. The actuator selection and design of robot electronics are also demonstrated. Finally, several applications are shown by incorporating different hardware based on the problem statement.},

Existing work tends to focus on component placement verification and solder joint analysis, etc. However, the detection of structural adhesives remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a vision-based method for detecting structural adhesive defects on PCBs. The method uses HSV color segmentation to extract PCB regions, followed by Hough-transform-based morphological analysis to identify board features. The perspective transformation then extracts and rectifies the adhesive regions, and constructs an adhesive region template by detecting the standard adhesive area ratio in its corresponding adhesive region. Finally, template matching is used to detect the structural adhesives. The experimental results show that this approach can accurately detect the adhesive state of PCBs and identify the qualified/unqualified locations, providing an effective vision-based detection scheme for PCB manufacturing. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) A vision-based structural adhesive detection method is proposed, and its detailed algorithm is presented. (2) The developed system includes a user-friendly visualization interface, streamlining the inspection workflow.

	abstract = {Whenever a user interacts with a device, mechanical work is performed to actuate the user interface elements; the resulting energy is typically wasted, dissipated as sound and heat. Previous work has shown that many devices can be powered entirely from this otherwise wasted user interface energy. For these devices, wires and batteries, along with the related hassles of replacement and charging, become unnecessary and onerous. So far, these works have been restricted to proof-of-concept demonstrations; a specific bespoke harvesting and sensing circuit is constructed for the application at hand. The challenge of harvesting energy while simultaneously sensing fine-grained input signals from diverse modalities makes prototyping new devices difficult. To fill this gap, we present a hardware toolkit which provides a common electrical interface for harvesting energy from user interface elements. This facilitates exploring the composability, utility, and breadth of enabled applications of interaction-powered smart devices. We design a set of "energy as input" harvesting circuits, a standard connective interface with 3D printed enclosures, and software libraries to enable the exploration of devices where the user action generates the energy needed to perform the device's primary function. This exploration culminated in a demonstration campaign where we prototype several exemplar popular toys and gadgets, including battery-free Bop-It— a popular 90s rhythm game, an electronic Etch-a-sketch, a "Simon-Says"-style memory game, and a service rating device. We run exploratory user studies to understand how generativity, creativity, and composability are hampered or facilitated by these devices. These demonstrations, user study takeaways, and the toolkit itself provide a foundation for building interactive and user-focused gadgets whose usability is not affected by battery charge and whose service lifetime is not limited by battery wear.},

We make the first attempt to shed light on satellite modem security. We first physically disassemble commodity satellite modems and systematically examine hardware and software modules. We perform a measurement study on the satellite modems that are exposed to the Internet. We identify 16 security vulnerabilities across three attack surfaces: satellite communication interface, ground network interface, and hardware. We further introduce AirSecAnalyzer, an automated security analyzer/fuzzer for the modems' satellite communication interface. Through comprehensive analysis and extensive experiments on 9 real-world satellite modems, we report 18 novel attacks that exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

In details, we first utilize a novel hybrid attention-based CNN+GRU model to re-characterize the original quality prediction network and reasonably replace the QARC's 1D-CNN layers with 2D-CNN layers. Using trace-driven experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of EQARC over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Next, we collect several useful information from each interpretable modules and learn the insight of EQARC. Following this step, we further propose AQARC (Advanced QARC), which is the light-weighted version of QARC. Experimental results show that AQARC achieves the same performances as the QARC with an overhead reduction of 90\%. In short, through learning from deep learning, we generalize a rate control method which can both reach high performance and reduce computation cost.},

This interconnection between hardware and software, however, makes the identification of bugs very difficult, as problems could be rooted in the program, in the circuit, or at their intersection. While there are tools to assist in identifying and resolving bugs, they typically require hardware instrumentation or visualizing logs in serial monitors. Based on the findings of a formative study, we designed Inline a programming tool that simplifies debugging of embedded systems by making explicit the internal state of the hardware and the program's execution flow using visualizations of the hardware logs directly within the user's code. The system's key characteristics are 1) an inline presentation of logs within the code, 2) real-time tracking of the execution flow, and 3) an expression language to manipulate and filter the logs. The paper presents the detailed implementation of the system and a study with twelve users, which demonstrates what features were adopted and how they were leveraged to complete debugging tasks.},

	abstract = {We introduce a modification of an established reinforcement learning method to facilitate the widespread use of temporal difference learning for IR: interpolated substate temporal difference (ISSTD) learning. While reinforcement learning methods have shown success in document ranking, these contributions have relied on relatively antiquated policy gradient methods like REINFORCE. These methods bring associated issues like high variance gradient estimates and sample inefficiency, which presents significant obstacles when training deep neural retrieval models. Within the reinforcement learning community, there exists a substantial body of work on alternative methods of training which revolve around temporal difference updates, such as Q-learning, Actor-Critic, or SARSA, that resolve some of the issues seen in REINFORCE. However, temporal difference methods require the full size of the state to be modeled internally within the ranking model, which is unrealistic for deep full text retrieval or first stage retrieval. We therefore propose ISSTD, operating on the substate, or individual documents in the case of matching models, and interpolating the temporal difference updates to the rest of the state. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence, enabling the drop in use of ISSTD for any algorithm that relies on temporal difference updates.

	abstract = {With the improvement of integrated circuit integration, the industrial complexity of printed circuit boards is gradually increasing, and the defects generated in the manufacturing process are also more subtle and complex. Traditional target detection methods are difficult to meet the needs of industrial detection. In order to reduce the error detection and missed detection in the defect detection of printed circuit boards, and effectively improve the detection accuracy under the premise of ensuring the detection speed, a defect detection algorithm for printed circuit boards based on improved Yolov5s is proposed. Firstly, the BiFPN ( Bidirectional Feature Pyramid ) is combined in the neck network, and the PANet in the Yolov5s benchmark structure is replaced by the BIFPN structure, and the bidirectional cross-scale connection is used to enhance the feature representation ability. Secondly, the Transformer layer module is designed by using the attention mechanism, and the sparse Transformer is proposed. The deformable layer contains a multi-head attention structure, which reduces the time complexity of the self-attention mechanism operation. Finally, the SE ( Squeeze-and-Excitation ) attention module is embedded in the basic network architecture to improve the performance of the model, so that it can better focus on important features and improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the average accuracy value ( mAP @ 0.5 ) of the improved Yolov5s model for defect detection of printed circuit boards reaches 97.7 \%, which is 2.3 \% higher than that before the model improvement, and can meet the requirements of industrial detection.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel circle detection framework integrated with an object detection network to accurately locate circular Printed Circuit Board (PCB) marks. By leveraging the object detection network for coarse localization, it becomes possible to effectively suppress complex backgrounds and reduce noise interference. In this work, the FasterNet network replaces the original backbone network in PicoDet, resulting in reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the incorporation of the ECA module enables more comprehensive capture of channel interactions while introducing minimal additional parameters and computational overhead. To achieve precise circle fitting, a novel point selection method named GOPS-CF, which relies on preset circle centers, is proposed. Moreover, the introduction of gradient descent and self-stop strategies enhances the stability and accuracy of the fitting results. Through comparative experiments and ablation studies compared to traditional methods, the superior performance of the proposed detection framework is demonstrated in terms of recognition success rate, positioning accuracy, and runtime. These findings underscore the significant implications of this framework for optimizing PCB automation production.},

	abstract = {In the power supply system, transmission lines are a very important part, which directly affects the safe and stable operation of power supply. The operation, maintenance and repair of transmission lines are also very important. The corrosion environment of metals is complex, with significant differences in rust areas and shapes, making it difficult to detect rust. When there are defects and hidden dangers in power lines, it is difficult to detect them in a timely manner using traditional manual inspection methods, which can easily lead to various line faults and power supply interruptions. Based on this, this article proposes a rust detection method that combines the Faster-RCNN object detection model based on deep learning with the HIS (Hue, Saturation, and Intensity) color features of rust. The experimental results indicate that the application of drone technology in the inspection of overhead transmission line channels has greatly changed the detection method of overhead transmission lines. Compared with manual inspection, the method proposed in this paper can independently complete the inspection and fully cross the obstacles encountered on the line. By using the intelligent detection equipment carried by the robot to evaluate and detect the line, it can significantly improve detection efficiency, accuracy, adaptability to the environment, and reduce inspection costs.CCS CONCEPTS • Human-centered computing∼Visualization∼Visualization application domains∼Visual analytics},

Traditional image measurement techniques, while foundational, often fall short of achieving the high degree of accuracy and precision necessary for today’s complex PCB designs. This research presents a novel approach that significantly enhances measurement accuracy through the application of optimized image processing techniques. By leveraging advanced algorithms within the OpenCV library, we introduce a methodology that accurately transforms pixel coordinates into real-world measurements, crucial for precise PCB alignment. Our technique employs edge detection algorithms such as Canny, Sobel, and Prewit filters, combined with a machine learning model that adapts to variations in real-time imaging conditions. The study delineates the development of a user-friendly graphical interface that streamlines the measurement process, making it accessible for practical industrial application. Results from experimental validations indicate a substantial improvement in measurement precision, with a demonstrable reduction in alignment errors compared to conventional methods. This leap forward not only promises to elevate the standards of PCB manufacturing but also opens avenues for similar advancements in other domains where image measurement is essential. The implications of this work are far-reaching, with the potential to significantly boost the efficiency and reliability of electronic manufacturing processes globally.},

Additionally, using the occlusion-aware attention mechanism MultiSEAM improves the resolution of feature maps, aiding in the detection of small targets. Finally, training and testing were conducted on a PCB dataset published by Peking University.

The model first adds a Biformer attention mechanism with good performance for small object detection to the SPFF module and Neck layer of the YOLOv8s network, reducing the model's attention to irrelevant information in PCB images and enhancing its ability to learn key features; Secondly, referring to the multi-scale feature fusion network Bi FPN, the output of shallow feature maps in the backbone network is connected across scales with the detection head, so that the detailed information of shallow feature maps is guided by the semantic information of deep feature maps, and the model's understanding ability of PCB image content is improved; Finally, the cross entropy loss function in the original YOLOV8 model was replaced with Focal Loss to make the model more focused on difficult to classify targets, thereby improving overall accuracy.},

	abstract = {Accurate characterization of the skin is essential for optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic dermatological tools, as well as technologies like pulse oximetry that rely on skin perfusion. Traditionally, optical spectroscopy has been used for skin assessments through devices like commercial colorimeters, which are high-cost instruments that, while precise, only provide single measurements rather than continuous data. Additionally, medical wearable devices that use this technology often show variable accuracy based on skin tone. The limitations of existing devices demonstrate the need for a solution that can provide low-cost, accurate, and continuous skin monitoring across varying skin tones in a wearable form-factor. This paper introduces DermaGlow, a novel wearable optical spectroscopy framework designed for low-cost, non-invasive monitoring of melanin, erythema, and skin tone. DermaGlow utilizes an off-the-shelf multi-spectrum wearable device available in various configurations to enable real-time, personalized assessments across diverse skin conditions and skin tones. We assess the performance of the DermaGlow algorithm against a state-of-the-art colorimeter in a comprehensive user study involving a diverse group of 77 subjects, demonstrating a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 5.33\% (melanin) and 4.18\% (erythema), and ΔE values less than 2.5 for CIE LAB measurements. Furthermore, we present an algorithm that utilizes DermaGlow outputs to correct for pulse oximeter inaccuracies typically found in those with darker skin pigmentation, resulting in an up to 75\% decrease in mean absolute error (MAE) in hypoxic readings across skin tones relative to arterial blood measurements. Our findings highlight DermaGlow's potential for short and long-term skin monitoring and as a significant enhancement to existing wearable devices, particularly in improving the accuracy of pulse oximeter readings across different skin tones.},

As recently studied, hardware Trojan greatly challenges the security of PCB. To tackle this issue, we propose a board-level hardware Trojan detection method that can distinguish the Trojan-infected PCBs from Trojan-free ones without a golden model, meanwhile, locate the Trojans on the infected board. First, we obtain all the thermal conductivity maps for a group of unauthentic PCBs. For each position of the map, we construct a feature matrix which involves the thermal conductivity values at the same position of all the boards. After that, we apply the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm on each feature matrix to find the Trojan-infected PCBs. Finally, according to the clustering results, we locate the Trojan position on the infected boards. The experimental results on the well-recognized PCBench reveal that our method is effective. In general, the detection accuracy achieves up to 96.3\% and the location error is less than 2.2\%, even though the Trojan is as small as 3.9 mm2.},

Next, a series of image preprocessing operations are carried out on the original image, including Gaussian filtering and smoothing of the image to remove noise, gamma transform image enhancement and edge detection preprocessing operations, and the use of Canny edge detection to obtain images with good foreground and background contrast, appropriate brightness, and prominent edges. Finally, a circle fitting algorithm based on KMeans++ was used to locate the extracted edge images of bottle mouth, bottle stopper, and bottle cap, and the experimental results were preliminarily analyzed.},

	abstract = {Automated segmentation of medical image volumes promises to reduce costly medical experts’ time for annotation. However, using machine learning for the task is challenging due to variations in imaging modalities and scarcity of patient data. While interactive image segmentation methods and foundational models incorporating user-provided prompts to refine segmentation masks have shown promise, they overlook crucial sequential information between the slices in 3D medical image volumes and videos, resulting in discontinuities in the segmentation results. This paper proposes a new framework that dynamically updates model parameters during inference in a test time training framework using user-provided scribbles. Our framework preserves acquired knowledge from the previous slices of the current medical volume and the training dataset via student-teacher learning. We evaluate our method on diverse CT, MRI, and microscopic cell datasets. Our framework significantly reduces user annotation time by a factor of 6.72 ×. Compared to other interactive segmentation methods, we reduce the time by a factor of 2.64 ×. Our method also outperforms prompting foundation models for segmentation by achieving a dice score of 0.9 in 3-4 interactions compared to 5-8 user interactions for the foundation model, significantly reducing annotation time for the CT and MRI volumes.},

	abstract = {As tools for designing and manufacturing hardware become more accessible, smaller producers can develop and distribute novel hardware. However, processes for supporting end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance aren’t well defined. As a result, providing technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by patterns that helped scale software troubleshooting, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow.SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware. A scene comprises a 3D Gaussian Splat of the user’s hardware registered onto the hardware’s CAD model. The splat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model acts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With SplatOverflow, remote maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user’s workspace. Workflows containing multiple instructions can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments.In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, the workflows it enables, and its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a usability study.Project Page: https://amritkwatra.com/research/splatoverflow.},

Three PCA algorithms were implemented for feature extraction and sparse representation. A novel strip PCA (SPCA) with nongreedy L1-norm maximization is proposed for VE image analysis. The extracted principal components were interpreted by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method for automated celiac disease classification. A benchmark dataset of 460 images (240 from celiac disease patients with small intestinal villous atrophy versus 220 control patients lacking villous atrophy) was constructed from the clinical VE series. It was found that the newly developed SPCA with nongreedy L1-norm maximization was most efficient for computerized celiac disease recognition, having a robust performance with an average recognition accuracy of 93.9 percent. Furthermore, SPCA also has a reduced computation time as compared with other methods. Therefore, it is likely that SPCA will be a helpful adjunct for the diagnosis of celiac disease.},

The effect of the lattice imperfection layers' refractive index upon the center frequency and intensity of the defect mode's transmission peak was deeply analyzed. It is proven that tuning the transmission frequency of the Terahertz wave can be accomplished by changing the incident angle of the Terahertz wave or altering the refractive index and width of the defect layers; changing the defect layer number can realize multi-channel filtering and tuning of the Terahertz wave. Thus they can be applied to design of the Terahertz optical switch. Finally, the electro-optical crystal Lithium Niobate and the ferroelectric liquid crystal material (FLC) are taken as the defect layer of the photonic crystal to design the Terahertz optical switch and the multi-channel filter. Optical switch control within a tunable frequency band of 100G can be achieved by using them.},

These themes highlight the challenge of LCA data collection and reveal distributed decision-making processes where responsibility for sustainable design choices—and their associated costs—is often ambiguous. Our analysis identifies opportunities for HCI technologies to support LCA computation and its integration into the design process to facilitate sustainability-oriented decision-making. While this work provides a nuanced discussion about sustainable design in the information and communication technologies (ICT) hardware industry, we hope our insights will also be valuable to other sectors.},

By harnessing solar radiation, photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight into electricity. In the context of Oman, with its ample solar potential, this technology holds significant promise. However, the challenge of soiling, where dust and other substances accumulate on solar panels, poses a substantial obstacle. Soiling degradation leads to decreased sunlight penetration and reduced electricity generation [1]. Investigations have shown energy output reductions of up to 50\% due to soiling [2]. To address this, effective cleaning mechanisms are crucial, with automated robotic systems emerging as a preferred solution [3].This paper synthesizes the research landscape, highlighting the impact of soiling on PV modules and the imperative for regular cleaning. Solar cleaning robots represent a pivotal innovation, integrating advanced technologies to optimize cleaning efficiency and mitigate power losses [4]. The proposed Solar Cleaning Robot prototype not only addresses the mechanical and electrical intricacies of its design but also underscores its role in elevating energy generation from local PV systems in Oman. During the course of this project, the paper contributes to the advancement of solar power systems in the region, ensuring optimal efficiency amidst Oman's conditions.},

	abstract = {The increasing importance of supply chain security for digital devices—from consumer electronics to critical infrastructure—has created a high demand for skilled cybersecurity experts. These experts use Hardware Reverse Engineering (HRE) as a crucial technique to ensure trust in digital semiconductors. Recently, the US and EU have provided substantial funding to educate this cybersecurity-ready semiconductor workforce, but success depends on the widespread availability of academic training programs. In this paper, we investigate the current state of education in hardware security and HRE to identify efficient approaches for establishing effective HRE training programs. Through a systematic literature review, we uncover 13 relevant courses, including eight with accompanying academic publications. We identify common topics, threat models, key pedagogical features, and course evaluation methods. We find that most hardware security courses do not prioritize HRE, making HRE training scarce. While the predominant course structure of lectures paired with hands-on projects appears to be largely effective, we observe a lack of standardized evaluation methods and limited reliability of student self-assessment surveys. Our results suggest several possible improvements to HRE education and yield recommendations for developing new training courses. We advocate for the integration of HRE education into curriculum guidelines to meet the growing societal and industry demand for HRE experts.},

On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of such systems poses significant challenges in software design, for the system payload. We focus on image compression and processing for scientific space missions, a vital functionality, due to the limited onboard storage capacity and the infrequent time periods, in which a satellite in orbit can send images to the ground, through a limited bandwidth connection. For CubeSat systems, the performance of image processing depends - even more than other space systems - on trade-offs, which are influenced by size, power and complexity constraints. In this context, we present the design challenges and the image compression/processing solution developed, for a university CubeSat built to carry on a biological experiment. All changes of the performance capability in the different parts of the payload image data chain (image resolution, onboard storage capacity, communication channel bandwidth and error characteristics) are taken into account. Moreover, any decision that increases the risk of incorrect reception of images from the experiment is weighted against the benefits of improved performance. We provide experimental results that show how our image processing solution resolves the associated trade-offs, while fulfilling the mission requirements.},

Featured by their miniaturization and misleading appearances, GPS devices can be easily disguised in their surroundings making their detection extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel side-channel-driven detection system, GPSBuster, leveraging electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by GPS trackers. Our feasibility studies and hardware analysis reveal that unique EMR patterns associated with the tracker's operation, stemming from the quartz oscillator, local oscillator, and mixer in the Mixed-Signal on Chip (MSoC) system. Nevertheless, as a side-channel leakage, EMRs can be extremely weak and suffer from the ambient noise interference, rendering the detection impractical. To address these challenges, we develop the signal processing techniques with noise removals and a dual-dimensional folding mechanism to accumulate the spectrum energy and protrude the EMR patterns with high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). Our detection prototype, built with a portable HackRF One device, allows users to perform a scan-to-detect manner and achieves an overall success rate of 98.4\% on top-10 selling GPS trackers under various testing cases. The maximum detection range is 0.61m.},

	abstract = {This study is performed for the quality improvement for Yamato NN Chair at PT Chitose Internasional Tbk. It is one of many large companies in Bandung which focuses on the furniture industry. Its folding chairs have become an icon of the company. The product has defects that can not be accepted by consumers. The method that can be used by PT Chitose Internasional Tbk in improving the quality is Six Sigma DMAIC. Six Sigma DMAIC method is continuous improvement of quality to reach 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities) or sigma level of six. There are three major processes involved in the production of folding chairs, namely construction, finishing, and assembly process. Among those processes, the assembly process of Yamato NN has the highest contribution to produce defective products. The sigma level in this process was 4.082. There are five phases that have to be done in using this method, namely Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. There are corrective actions that had been done in the assembly process. The result from implementing Six Sigma DMAIC in PT Chitose Internasional Tbk was sigma level increased to 4.247.},

	abstract = {At the end of 2019, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started and as of now, it is still the number one problem of the world today. This virus can be transmitted through droplets of saliva from an infected person which can be from a sneeze, cough, and exhales. As of now, there are a total of 111 million cases of the virus and there are technologies that were introduced to help in the detection of the infection and to reduce the spread of the virus. One of this technology is the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Machine. This machine detects any specific genetic material, including a virus. Samples from the body are treated with several chemical solutions which remove substances and only allow Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to remain. But the problem with this machine is the elicitation of false-positive and false-negative results and certain malfunctions. Due to the issues in using RT-PCR, our team has come up with a newer and improvised version of the machine and called it COVIDBIT. COVIDBIT is a more simplified and portable version of the RT-PCR at a cheaper price. In this study, the team analyzed COVIDBIT as a virus detection device and an alternative for RT-PCR machine using SEM model and found out that there is a significant difference in terms of effectiveness and portability in usage and showed that the 210 respondents from the medical industry are most likely to use these kinds of machine.},

First, to ensure the content consistency in position and scale, we align the card to a standard film image through perspective transformation(PT) based on AKAZE key-points. Besides, we use contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization(CLAHE) to enhance the background pattern of a baseboard image, and then align it to the rectified card. Second, we apply multiply algorithm to synthesise the aligned film image and baseboard image as a reconstructed reference image. Besides, we align the lightness histogram of the reference image to a test card so as to eliminate the lighting difference. Finally, we apply the difference image method based on canny edge detection to detect difference between a reference image with a card, and further extract the defect information. We experiment on cards with different types of defects and shooting disturbances. Results show high accuracy of our method.},

	abstract = {Malignant melanoma is one of the most lethal forms of cancer when not detected early. As a result, cancer screening programs have been implemented internationally, all of which require visual inspection of skin lesions. Early melanoma detection is a crucial competence in medical and dermatological education, and it is primarily trained using 2D imagery. However, given the intrinsic 3D nature of skin lesions and the importance of incorporating additional contextual information about the patient (e.g., skin type, nearby lesions, etc.), this approach falls short of providing a comprehensive and scalable learning experience. A potential solution is the use of Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios, which can offer an effective strategy to train skin cancer screenings in a realistic 3D setting, thereby enhancing medical students’ awareness of early melanoma detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive pipeline and models for generating malignant melanomas and benign nevi, which can be utilized in VR-based medical training. We use diffusion models for the generation of skin lesions, which we have enhanced with various guiding strategies to give educators maximum flexibility in designing scenarios and seamlessly placing lesions on virtual agents. Additionally, we have developed a tool which comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) enabling the generation of new lesions and adapting existing ones using an intuitive and interactive inpainting strategy. The tool also offers a novel custom upsampling strategy to achieve a sufficient resolution required for diagnostic purposes. The generated skin lesions have been validated in a user study with trained dermatologists, confirming the overall high quality of the generated lesions and the utility for educational purposes.},

Advances in wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things have led to technologies nominally suited to support remote sensing; however, in practice long-running deployments of in-field environmental sensors are rare. Field conditions are often remote and culturally sensitive, with limited power, Internet, transportation, and human infrastructure; advances in device technology alone will not suffice. We ask how communities, Internet of Things researchers, government, and other interested parties can work together to co-design useful, low burden, sustainability-focused infrastructure. Toward this end, we conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with 13 experts who use or rely on environmental sensing technology. To complement our interview data, we engaged in three months of participant observation while immersed in organizations specifically working toward manoomin (wild rice) conservation. We make two primary contributions. First, we confirm and enrich a five-stage model, the microclimate sensor lifecycle, focusing on desired features and persistent challenges. Second, we outline a space for co-design of microclimate sensors with emphasis on the cost of experience, the generally unaddressed issue of technical usability in the messy field, and the opportunity for community engagement to improve technical design and outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss future design opportunities, recommendations, and challenges in the microclimate sensor design, deployment, and sustainability space.},

	abstract = {With the development of AIGC, images generated by AI are difficult to identify with the human eye. This article proposes a simple training architecture and a simple model. In the training process of deep forgery detection, a variety of data enhancement techniques are used, including horizontal flipping, adding Gaussian noise and random cropping to enhance the generalization ability of the model. Differentiated processing strategies are adopted for images of different sizes: center cropping is used for images smaller than 224 pixels, random cropping is used for images between 224 and 512 pixels, and images larger than 512 pixels are first scaled and then randomly cropped. Furthermore, the concept of neighbor pixel relations (NPR) is introduced, which is an effective way to capture local structural artifacts introduced by upsampling operations. As a complement to image representation, NPR significantly improves the detector's ability to identify forged images, especially when the forgery technology is unknown. By integrating the NPR module into the ResNet-50 model, it not only enhances the classifier's extraction of forged features, but also maintains the computational efficiency and versatility of the model. Finally, AIGC generated images in the ”Malanshan Cup" International Audio-Video Algorithm Competition. Determine the first place result for the track.},

Among these, CutMix stands out for improving the accuracy by combining patches of different images. However, it is still unclear why they provide a stable training process. This study focuses on evaluating the performance of normal augmentation as well as normal with CutMix augmentation by some specific training dynamic properties such as loss landscape, effective β -smoothness, and gradient predictiveness. We also aim to see if these properties can be upheld for generalizability. For this purpose, we train ResNet-50 and ConvMixer models on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under both regular and CutMix augmentation conditions. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of effective β -smoothness and gradient predictiveness we can see a significant distinction in results between normal augmentation and advanced augmentation. The CutMix augmentation not only excels at better accuracy but also prevents variability and fluctuations in gradients. Additionally, through the loss landscape, we see that the ConvMixer shows lower training loss and ResNet exhibits stable training progression. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of augmentation benefits as well as model selection in neural network training and emphasize the importance of dynamic training properties in achieving optimal performance.},

	abstract = {The localization of image Copy-move forgery has always posed a significant challenge in the field of image forensics. In this study, we propose an image Copy-move tampering localization method by using Segment Anything Model (SAM). The SAM technology is employed in this method to conduct panoramic segmentation of the initial image. Subsequently, the size, shape, and distribution characteristics of the segmented units are utilized for selecting comparable segmentation units. The statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation) of each pixel within these units are then extracted as feature vectors. Ultimately, by comparing the matching degree between each semantic unit and its corresponding feature vector, tampered regions can be identified. The proposed approach distinguishes itself from traditional keypoint-based and block-based image Copy-move detection methods by offering easier implementation and reduced computational resource requirements. It has demonstrated exceptional performance in terms of localization accuracy, effectively addressing the limitations of earlier technologies that struggled with inadequate localization for small-sized tampering regions and low accuracy due to the absence of keypoints in flat areas. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on a dataset created for this study and the well-established COVERGE dataset, which substantiate the superiority of the algorithm in terms of accuracy and robustness against prevalent image manipulations.},

	abstract = {Drones, known for their remarkable environmental adaptability and operational independence, are increasingly utilized across diverse applications. Despite their versatility, the limited efficiency of energy transmission hampers their potential for further advancement. Wireless charging is recognized as a crucial technology to sustain drone operations and enhance energy transfer. However, encountering issues such as mutual inductance disruptions due to positioning errors and environmental irregularities, which compromise power transmission efficiency. Additionally, the challenge of achieving a lightweight design for the receiver unit and ensuring swift energy replenishment remains significant in drone wireless charging technology. To address these challenges, this paper proposes enhancements in three critical areas: the design of coil windings, the topology of the circuit structure, and the design of the charging pad. These optimizations aim to improve the energy transmission efficiency of drone wireless charging systems while maintaining drone stability and minimizing weight. Specifically, the study suggests refining the coil's winding structure and upgrading the coil material to enhance the quality factor and reduce energy losses. To further enhance the coupling coefficient of the wireless charging system, the paper advocates employing an LCC-S/P/LCC topology for the compensation circuit, offering greater control flexibility and better impedance matching. Moreover, the study proposes optimizing the pad structure as an alternative to conventional coils. This modification enhances the coupling coefficient and energy transfer efficiency, offering a promising new direction for future research. The findings provide a valuable framework for advancing the efficiency of UAV wireless charging systems and highlight significant opportunities for ongoing research.},

	abstract = {Deep learning-based methods have been widely used in product surface defect detection tasks. Recently, end-to-end mixed supervision networks based on end-to-end have performed well in industrial surface defect detection tasks, achieving better results than weakly supervised and fully supervised methods when weak labelling is allowed, but at significantly lower cost. However, the structure of such networks is complex and the learning process is slow. In this paper, we make lightweight improvements to the mixed supervision network, enabling the network to learn using a small number of positive samples, reducing the computational effort while maintaining network performance. We dynamically adjust the loss during learning and make the network more stable by adjusting the gradient flow during learning. The experiments on the defect detection dataset DAGM yielded good results. We also present a new dataset called MetalSDD(Metal Surface Defects Dataset), which contains more than 1000 images, mainly of rusted metal workpiece surfaces from real industrial environments. We show advanced results on two existing datasets. To validate the generality of the network, we also performed comparative experiments with the MetalSDD dataset against five currently popular anomaly detection networks, showing that our approach requires only a small amount of detailed annotation to produce comparable performance to the SOTA(state-of-the-art)model .},

	abstract = {The quality of semiconductor lead frame exposure products will affect the quality of the finished lead frame, and then affect the life of the chip. Affected by the production process, there will be copper exposure, copper deficiency, foreign body and other defects on the surface of the exposed product, these defects are generally small in size, complex and changeable structure, and it is not easy to distinguish from the background texture, and leakage and misjudgment often occur in the detection process. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8 defect detection algorithm. First, DSCONV was introduced to improve the sensitivity of the model to foreign body defects shaped like hair analogs. Secondly, the SPPFCSPC module is used to replace the SPPF module in the original network Backbone and fuse the feature information of different scales. Finally, in order to further improve the detection accuracy, CBAM, a hybrid attention mechanism with better effect, is added to enhance the ability of the network to represent defect features. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8 model has made remarkable progress in improving the detection results, and the MAP value reaches 91.1\%.},

To facilitate the design of Xstrings objects, we present a design tool that allows users to embed cable-driven mechanisms into object geometries based on their desired interactions by automatically placing joints and cables inside the object. To assess our system, we investigate the effect of printing parameters on the strength of Xstrings objects and the extent to which the interactions are repeatable without cable breakage.

Firstly, Shufflenetv2 is employed to replace the YOLOv5s backbone network, while the Focus layer in the model is removed to avoid repeated use of slice operations, reducing the parameter and computational complexity of the algorithm network model. Secondly, the improved Fast Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPPF) module is embedded into the backbone network to enhance the algorithm’s detection accuracy. Finally, the Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss function is replaced with Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU). Results on the aluminum sheet defect dataset show that the detection speed reaches 90.3 frames per second on a PC, a 34\% improvement over the original version. Simulation on an FPGA development board demonstrates that the improved algorithm achieves a detection speed of 75.6 frames per second and an accuracy of 93.1\% mAP@0.5.},

For practical everyday use, smart clothing should (1) be available in a range of sizes to accommodate different fit preferences, and (2) be washable to allow repeated use. In SeamFit, we demonstrate washable T-shirts, embedded with capacitive seam electrodes, available in three different sizes, for exercise logging. Our T-shirt design, customized signal processing \&amp; machine learning pipeline allow the SeamFit system to generalize across users, fits, and wash cycles. Prior wearable exercise logging solutions, which often attach a miniaturized sensor to a body location, struggle to track exercises that mainly involve other body parts. SeamFit T-shirt naturally covers a large area of the body and still tracks exercises that mainly involve uncovered joints (e.g., elbows and the lower body). In a user study with 15 participants performing 14 exercises, SeamFit detects exercises with an accuracy of 89\%, classifies exercises with an accuracy of 93.4\%, and counts exercises with an error of 0.9 counts, on average.

	abstract = {With the continuous advancement of computer vision, image processing technologies, volumetric video, represented by point cloud videos, holds the potential for extensive applications in areas such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Viewport prediction, also referred to as Field of View (FoV) prediction, is a crucial component in emerging VR and AR applications, playing a vital role in the transmission of point cloud videos. Currently, models for viewpoint prediction that integrate feature extraction and FoV information heavily rely on the spatial-temporal features extracted by convolutional neural networks. However, the drawback of 3D convolution lies in its inability to effectively capture long-term spatial-temporal dependencies within videos. Moreover, the temporal contrast layer used for time feature extraction only compares features within each block, leading to matching errors and inaccurate temporal feature extraction, consequently diminishing predictive performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Transformer-based Volumetric Point Cloud Video Viewport Prediction Network (VPFormer) that can efficiently extract spatial-temporal features from point cloud videos. VPFormer constitutes a viewport prediction framework that combines the spatial-temporal features of point cloud videos with user trajectory information. Specifically, we introduce a novel sampling method that effectively preserves spatial-temporal information while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we incorporate context-aware dynamic positional encoding to capture inter-frame spatial-temporal context information. Subsequently, we introduce a voxel-based temporal contrast layer and partition the point cloud into smaller voxel blocks during feature matching, significantly reducing matching errors and enhancing the analysis and extraction of temporal features. Finally, by combining the spatial-temporal features of point cloud videos with user head trajectory information, we successfully predict future user viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other solutions in terms of performance.},

	abstract = {Accurate navigation is of paramount importance to ensure flight safety and efficiency for autonomous drones. Recent research starts to use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to enhance drone navigation given their remarkable predictive capability for visual perception. However, existing solutions either run DNN inference tasks on drones in situ, impeded by the limited onboard resource, or offload the computation to external servers which may incur large network latency. Few works consider jointly optimizing the offloading decisions along with image transmission configurations and adapting them on the fly. In this paper, we propose A3D, an edge server assisted drone navigation framework that can dynamically adjust task execution location, input resolution, and image compression ratio in order to achieve low inference latency, high prediction accuracy, and long flight distances. Specifically, we first augment state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for drone navigation and define a novel metric called Quality of Navigation as our optimization objective which can effectively capture the above goals. We then design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based neural scheduler at the drone side for which an information encoder is devised to reshape the state features and thus improve its learning ability. To further support simultaneous multi-drone serving, we extend the edge server design by developing a network-aware resource allocation algorithm, which allows provisioning containerized resources aligned with drones’ demand. We finally implement a proof-of-concept prototype with realistic devices and validate its performance in a real-world campus scene, as well as a simulation environment for thorough evaluation upon AirSim. Extensive experimental results show that A3D can reduce end-to-end latency by 28.06\% and extend the flight distance by up to 27.28\% compared with non-adaptive solutions.},

However, most influence-estimation techniques are designed for deep learning models with continuous parameters. Gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are a powerful and widely-used class of models; however, these models are black boxes with opaque decision-making processes. In the pursuit of better understanding GBDT predictions and generally improving these models, we adapt recent and popular influence-estimation methods designed for deep learning models to GBDTs. Specifically, we adapt representer-point methods and TracIn, denoting our new methods TREX and BoostIn, respectively; source code is available at https://github.com/jjbrophy47/tree\_influence. We compare these methods to LeafInfluence and other baselines using 5 different evaluation measures on 22 real-world data sets with 4 popular GBDT implementations. These experiments give us a comprehensive overview of how different approaches to influence estimation work in GBDT models. We find BoostIn is an efficient influence-estimation method for GBDTs that performs equally well or better than existing work while being four orders of magnitude faster. Our evaluation also suggests the gold-standard approach of leave-one-out (LOO) retraining consistently identifies the single-most influential training example but performs poorly at finding the most inuential set of training examples for a given target prediction.},

However, prolonged arm movements induce shoulder fatigue—known as "Gorilla Arm Syndrome"—degrading user experience and reducing interaction duration. Although existing ergonomic techniques derived from Fitts’ law (such as reducing target distance, increasing target width, and modifying control-display gain) provide some fatigue mitigation, their implementation in XR applications remains challenging due to the complex balance between user engagement and physical exertion. We present AlphaPIG, a meta-technique designed to Prolong Interactive Gestures by leveraging real-time fatigue predictions. AlphaPIG assists designers in extending and improving XR interactions by enabling automated fatigue-based interventions. Through adjustment of intervention timing and intensity decay rate, designers can explore and control the trade-off between fatigue reduction and potential effects such as decreased body ownership. We validated AlphaPIG’s effectiveness through a study (N=22) implementing the widely-used Go-Go technique. Results demonstrated that AlphaPIG significantly reduces shoulder fatigue compared to non-adaptive Go-Go, while maintaining comparable perceived body ownership and agency. Based on these findings, we discuss positive and negative perceptions of the intervention. By integrating real-time fatigue prediction with adaptive intervention mechanisms, AlphaPIG constitutes a critical first step towards creating fatigue-aware applications in XR.},

	title = {The impacts of dimensionality, diffusion, and directedness on intrinsic universality in the abstract tile assembly model},
	abstract = {In this paper we present a series of results related to mathematical models of self-assembling systems of tiles and the impacts that three diverse properties have on their dynamics. In these self-assembling systems, initially unorganized collections of tiles undergo random motion and can bind together, if they collide and enough of their incident glues match, to form assemblies. Here we greatly expand upon a series of prior results which showed that (1) the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is intrinsically universal (FOCS 2012), and (2) the class of directed aTAM systems is not intrinsically universal (FOCS 2016). Intrinsic universality (IU) for a model (or class of systems within a model) means that there is a universal tile set which can be used to simulate an arbitrary system within that model (or class). Furthermore, the simulation must not only produce the same resultant structures, it must also maintain the full dynamics of the systems being simulated and display the same behaviors modulo a scale factor. While the FOCS 2012 result showed that the standard, two-dimensional (2D) aTAM is IU, here we show that this is also the case for the three-dimensional (3D) version. Conversely, the FOCS 2016 result showed that the class of aTAM systems which are directed (a.k.a. deterministic, or confluent) is not IU, meaning that there is no universal simulator which can simulate directed aTAM systems while itself always remaining directed, implying that nondeterminism is fundamentally required for such simulations. Here, however, we show that, in 3D, the class of directed aTAM systems is actually IU, i.e. there is a universal directed simulator for them. This implies that the constraint of tiles binding only in the plane forced the necessity of nondeterminism for the simulation of 2D directed systems. This then leads us to continue to explore the impacts of dimensionality and directedness on simulation of tile-based self-assembling systems by considering the influence of more rigid notions of dimensionality. Namely, we introduce the Planar aTAM, where tiles are not only restricted to binding in the plane, but they are also restricted to traveling within the plane, and we prove that the Planar aTAM is not IU, and prove that the class of directed systems within the Planar aTAM also is not IU. Finally, analogous to the Planar aTAM, we introduce the Spatial aTAM, its 3D counterpart, and prove that the Spatial aTAM is IU. This paper adds to a broad set of results which have been used to classify and compare the relative powers of differing models and classes of self-assembling systems, and also helps to further the understanding of the roles of dimension and nondeterminism on the dynamics of self-assembling systems. Furthermore, to prove our positive results we have not only designed, but also implemented what we believe to be the first IU tile set ever implemented and simulated in any tile assembly model, and have made it, along with a simulator which can demonstrate it, freely available.},

Using AI components or micro benchmarks alone can lead to error-prone conclusions. This paper presents a methodology to attack the above challenge. We formalize a real-world application scenario as a Directed Acyclic Graph-based model and propose the rules to distill it into a permutation of essential AI and non-AI tasks, which we call a scenario benchmark. Together with seventeen industry partners, we extract nine typical scenario benchmarks. We design and implement an extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark framework. We implement two Internet service AI scenario benchmarks based on the framework as proxies to two real-world application scenarios.We consider scenario, component, and micro benchmarks as three indispensable parts for evaluating. Our evaluation shows the advantage of our methodology against using component or micro AI benchmarks alone.

	abstract = {Abstract: Smart tourism is an imperative innovation and reform in the tourism industry. In the process of building smart scenic areas, we need not only fully interpret the essential connotation of smart tourism in theory, but also comprehensively apply the latest technical support to build a variety of hardware platforms in smart scenic areas, thereby meeting the needs of scenic resource protection, business management, tourism management, public services, and decision support. By proposing hypotheses about the factors influencing tourist experience, we carefully designed questionnaires, conducted online surveys among 350 tourists, refined three influencing factors after dividing the influencing factors into categories and performing correlation analysis. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between smart guide platform, smart guide robot, smart supervision platform, and tourist experience, and the above factors play a significant positive role in improving the tourist experience. By comparing the standardized coefficient values, it can be seen that standardized coefficient value of the smart guide platform has relatively high absolute value, indicating its relatively big impact. Next comes smart supervision platform and smart guide robot. It suggests that in the construction of smart scenic areas, we should: expand the construction of smart guide platform, perfect the service feedback mechanism, accelerate the upgrading of smart guide robots, highlight the advantages of artificial intelligence, and promote the intelligent, real-time, and refined development of smart supervision platforms.},

This paper presents Widesee to realize wide-area sensing with only one transceiver pair. Widesee utilizes the LoRa signal to achieve a larger range of sensing and further incorporates drone’s mobility to broaden the sensing area. Widesee presents solutions across software and hardware to overcome two aspects of challenges for wide-range contactless sensing: (i) the interference brought by device mobility and LoRa’s high sensitivity; and (ii) the ambiguous target information such as location when employing just a single pair of transceivers for sensing. We have developed a working prototype of Widesee for human target detection and localization that are especially useful in emergency scenarios such as rescue search, and evaluated Widesee with both controlled experiments and the field study in a high-rise building. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great potential of Widesee for wide-area contactless sensing with a single LoRa transceiver pair hosted on a drone.},

	abstract = {The Internet's success arose from classical layering: protocols like TCP and Ethernet can be independently understood, changed, debugged, verified, and offloaded to hardware using a clean service interface between layers. To accrue the same benefits at a finer grain, we suggest sublayering, i.e., layering recursively within each layer. We show that the data link and routing layers have natural sublayers. However, while TCP intuitively decomposes into sub-functions (connection management, reliable delivery, congestion control) common state variables like sequence numbers and window sizes entangle these functions, making sublayering difficult. We propose an alternate sublayered TCP with equivalent functionality which enables easily changing congestion control and connection management. We also argue that sublayering can help create robust and verified Internet protocol implementations akin to seL4 for Operating Systems. To this end, we describe early experiments with a verified sublayered implementation of a simple bit-stuffing protocol using Coq, and a verified monolithic implementation of a lightweight TCP using Dafny. We end with a set of challenges for sublayered protocols.},

(2) Justification for less frequent averaging. (3) That we expect adaptive gradient methods to work equally well, or better, with iterate averaging than their non-adaptive counterparts. Inspired by these results, together with empirical investigations of the importance of appropriate regularisation for the solution diversity of the iterates, we propose two adaptive algorithms with iterate averaging. These give significantly better results compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), require less tuning and do not require early stopping or validation set monitoring.

	volume = {25},
	issn = {1532-4435},
	abstract = {In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multihead self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named crate, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of crate architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve strong performance across different settings: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the statistical performance of a robust spectral clustering method for latent structure recovery in noisy data matrices. We consider eigenvector-based clustering applied to a matrix of nonparametric rank statistics that is derived entrywise from the raw, original data matrix. This approach is robust in the sense that, unlike traditional spectral clustering procedures, it can provably recover population-level latent block structure even when the observed data matrix includes heavy-tailed entries and has a heterogeneous variance profile. Here, the raw input data may be viewed as a weighted adjacency matrix whose entries constitute links that connect nodes in an underlying graph or network.Our main theoretical contributions are threefold and hold under flexible data generating conditions. First, we establish that robust spectral clustering with rank statistics can consistently recover latent block structure, viewed as communities of nodes in a graph, in the sense that unobserved community memberships for all but a vanishing fraction of nodes are correctly recovered with high probability when the data matrix is large. Second, we refine the former result and further establish that, under certain conditions, the community membership of any individual, specified node of interest can be asymptotically exactly recovered with probability tending to one in the large-data limit. Third, we establish asymptotic normality results associated with the truncated eigenstructure of matrices whose entries are rank statistics, made possible by synthesizing contemporary entrywise matrix perturbation analysis with the classical nonparametric theory of so-called simple linear rank statistics. Collectively, these results demonstrate the statistical utility of rank-based data transformations when paired with spectral techniques for dimensionality reduction. Numerical examples illustrate and support our theoretical findings. Additionally, for a data set consisting of human connectomes, our approach yields parsimonious dimensionality reduction and improved recovery of ground-truth neuroanatomical cluster structure. We conclude with a discussion of extensions, practical considerations, and future work.},

It seems natural that one should be able to combine these techniques to beat the currently best bound of matrix multiplication time for computing persistent homology. However, nested dissection works by fixing a reduction order, whereas persistent homology generally constrains the ordering according to an input filtration. Despite this obstruction, we show that it is possible to combine these two theories. This shows that one can improve the computation of persistent homology if the underlying space has some additional structure. We give reasonable geometric conditions under which one can beat the matrix multiplication bound for persistent homology.},

We propose SimDiff to overcome these limitations by utilizing the denoising probabilistic diffusion model, a generative neural network capable of learning complex statistical distributions and efficiently sampling from them. Additionally, we introduce SimDiff-ConvTrans, an extension that incorporates Transformer and Convolution components for simulating non-i.i.d inputs.

Quantifying interdependencies between layers can identify redundancies in the structure of a network, indicate relationships between disparate layers, and potentially inform survey instruments for collecting social network data. We propose definitions of layer independence, dependence, and redundancy based on likelihood ratio tests between nested nonnegative Tucker decompositions. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we evaluate the use and interpretation of the NNTuck as a model of multilayer networks. Algorithmically, we show that using expectation maximization (EM) to maximize the log-likelihood under the NNTuck is step-by-step equivalent to tensorial multiplicative updates for the NNTuck under a KL loss, extending a previously known equivalence from nonnegative matrices to nonnegative tensors.},

However, existing coreset constructions are highly model-specific and are limited to simple models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means.

	abstract = {The online data markets have emerged as a valuable source of diverse datasets for training machine learning (ML) models. However, datasets from different data providers may exhibit varying levels of bias with respect to certain sensitive attributes in the population (such as race, sex, age, and marital status). Recent dataset acquisition research has focused on maximizing accuracy improvements for downstream model training, ignoring the negative impact of biases in the acquired datasets, which can lead to an unfair model. Can a consumer obtain an unbiased dataset from datasets with diverse biases? In this work, we propose a fairness-aware data acquisition framework (FairDA) to acquire high-quality datasets that maximize both accuracy and fairness for consumer local classifier training while remaining within a limited budget. Given the biases of data commodities remain opaque to consumers, the data acquisition in FairDA employs explore-exploit strategies. Based on whether exploration and exploitation are conducted sequentially or alternately, we introduce two algorithms: the knowledge-based offline data acquisition (KDA) and the reward-based online data acquisition algorithms (RDA). Each algorithm is tailored to specific customer needs, giving the former an advantage in computational efficiency and the latter an advantage in robustness. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data acquisition framework in steering users toward fairer model training compared to existing baselines under varying market settings.},
